<p class='c005'>Those low-lying hills were France!</p>

<p class='c006'>They had not lifted into view suddenly, but had
rather emerged from the east, solidifying slowly out of a
slate-colored blur which to the eyes of unaccustomed
voyagers might or might not have been land. There was
no ebullition of spirits. The two thousand men and
women aboard the vessel crowded to the rail and strained
their eyes toward that land in which great events awaited
them, for the most part in utter silence. Conversation
failed. There was an impressiveness about the moment
akin to the impressiveness of entering some great cathedral—there
was awe!... There, rising out of the east was
France!... <i>France</i>!</p>

<p class='c006'>The sentiment that stirred them was more profound
than a thrill. The day had held its thrill for them—a
thrill that for many of them had followed a sleepless
night. Those who had slept had done so fully clothed,
with life-jackets within instant touch of the hand. For
the kindly ocean had been made dangerous, not by the
elements, which throughout the voyage had held themselves
in restraint, but by men. It had been a morning
of mists which lay upon the placid waters and glowed in
response to the touch of the rising sun. Then, as the
luminous grayness dissipated, there came into view far off
to the northward, a spot which grew and approached until
it became a grim and business-like French destroyer to
be greeted with cheers of relief. It was the convoy.
There was a thrill. It spelled safety—that little boat
with ready guns—but it spoke of danger as well. The
early passengers who watched the approach of the little
vessel of war warmed with affection toward it. It was
their guardian, come out of nothingness to protect them
through the remaining perilous miles of ocean.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the cabin a little party of women had remained
through the night, fearful of the unseen, impressed by
the perils which might hide beneath the dark waters
which the bow of the vessel turned up into wonderful
patterns of phosphorescence. They had grouped together
to draw what comfort they could from companionship.
Now they emerged on deck relieved, almost jubilant,
until one of their number said, suddenly, “I am told
it is the last ten miles which is most dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The destroyer ran alongside, and a sailor with two
little flags waved a long message to the bridge; then she
dropped back astern, and with her passed that thrill
which had stirred the ship’s company.</p>

<p class='c006'>No, it was no thrill that moved the passengers on the
vessel as the hills of France arose before them; the emotion
was more profound, more impressive. To many of them
it was the first sight of a foreign shore, but, more than
that, it was their first sight of France—of that France
which by the greatness of her spirit during three years of
peril, of suffering, of horrors, had become not a country,
but a <i>symbol</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the most part the passengers were in uniform. In
these days there were no tourists, none who traveled
abroad for amusement or recreation or to accomplish that
object so dear to Americans—to improve the mind.
These voyagers went as servants, to take their part, great
or small, in that war which America had come to see at
last was <i>her</i> war.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were many young officers among the first-class
passengers, boyish lieutenants proud of unaccustomed
uniforms, a little set up because they were not as other
men; but all eager to be at their grim work. In a month
their swanking would be a thing of the past, for they
would have encountered reality, and out of the reality
they would emerge as men. There was a captain or so,
themselves boyish; there were Red Cross men who,
before assuming their uniforms, had been lawyers, merchants,
brokers. Older men there were, wearing well-tailored
uniforms and carrying themselves with assurance.
There was a considerable company of Y. M. C. A. workers,
on their way to do what came to hand. They were not
certain yet what it was to be, but they would learn.
Their uniforms were not so well tailored, their puttees
were not of expensive leather like those of the officers and
Red Cross men. As one reviewed them he saw that all
but a few were not members of the <i>executive</i> class, but
workers. They were coming to drive trucks, to sell
meager supplies over the makeshift counters of huts and
canteens, to serve the soldier in such ways as offered.</p>

<p class='c006'>And there were women—Red Cross women, Y. M. C. A.
women, a few musicians and entertainers come to lighten
the tedium of the boys in khaki. There were a few civilians,
French people, returning from America for purposes
important only to them. And there was a sprinkling of
French officers, among them a boyish hero much followed
by women’s eyes because he was a handsome boy made
more handsome by the splendor of his uniform—trousers
of red, long coat of black, and most of all, perhaps, by the
cluster of medals upon his breast. He was only a youth,
but he was France’s most famous aviator.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were third-class passengers. Forward were six
hundred Poles in vivid red coats, recruited in the United
States and Canada for the Polish Legion, going to fight
for their country, which could only be a member of the
family of nations if the Allies succeeded in crushing the
enemy. Aft there were six hundred American boys—machine-gun
men and a signal-corps unit.</p>

<p class='c006'>All of them—officers, men, women—knew that those hills
concealed something, something tremendous. Resident
in each individual was a consciousness that beyond there
lay a new world, but how new and how different none was
capable of realizing. The old life, the old ways, the
accustomed rules of the game of life, had been left behind
and few had the vision to perceive that they were left
behind forever, that nothing could again be as it had
been, and that they were standing poised for a step
through a doorway which led into a new era.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were about to find contact with another civilization,
with another philosophy, another method of life.
It was not alone that they were to be set down in an
alien land, amid a people speaking a tongue which was
meaningless to them, and living their lives according to
a manner which seemed good to them—and which <i>was</i>
good to them and to all who saw it with clear eyes and
open mind—but because they were about to become a
part of events through which no soul can pass without
being so modified and molded as to emerge a different
soul, detached, unrelated, cut off by experience and
knowledge from the soul that had been.</p>

<p class='c006'>Behind those low-lying hills lay France.... What
was France? It was, for every man and woman aboard
that vessel, the great adventure of the soul. Just that.
Each one of them was to be born again. With the
touch of the soil of France beneath their feet would come
a new birth, the entrance into a new life in which each
would find much to wonder at, much to admire, much to
puzzle over.... But they would find <i>themselves</i>. Moreover
they would find a world which had resolved itself
into genuineness, a world which was true, because war had
stripped it of pretense.</p>

<p class='c006'>The American soul is a peculiar affair. It is circumscribed
by environment, by inherited prejudices. It is,
for the most part, incapable of comprehending itself,
much less the soul of another people of another temperament
and genius, ripened by plenitude of years and by
a hundred generations of genius which has studied the art
of living. The American soul is a living thing imprisoned
in a cage of concealments. It was to come into intimate
contact with a people who do not believe in imprisoning
the soul, who have sought for and discovered the essentials,
and have cut away—perhaps have never found the
necessity for cutting away—the shame, the self-deceptions,
the glossings-over, the self-imposed blind spots, which
make us what we are. The American soul recognizes food
and admits it to thought’s decent society, but it declines
to recognize the existence of processes of digestion. The
French soul knows that food must be digested as well
as eaten. To the French soul digestion is respectable.</p>

<p class='c006'>So the American soul was to meet the French soul—a
meeting of the poles. From such a meeting must result
something worth while to the world....</p>

<p class='c006'>From that day, the 18th of May, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1918, those men
and women would calculate the events of their lives.
It was the beginning of a new dispensation. As the world
dates events as <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> or <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, so these Americans would
date their events as, “Before I landed in France,” or,
“After I landed in France.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was from the port side of the vessel that the best
view of the now distinct land was to be obtained, and the
rail was crowded from end to end of the long deck with
men and women who looked and looked as if land were a
new and tremendous curiosity, a something which they
had never seen before and might miss altogether if their
attention wavered for an instant. Tea and wafers had
just been served by the deck stewards. Well forward
stood a young man with the bars of a captain on his
shoulders; he stood back from the rail, alone, looking
over the heads of the other passengers, as his height
made it practicable for him to do. He held in his right
hand a cup of tea and was eating one of a handful of
square wafers. Not as a man eats who is dallying with
the quaint foreign custom of afternoon tea did he bear
himself, but as a young man who is honestly hungry.
He addressed himself to those biscuits and washed them
down with tea because it had been long hours since the
midday meal and because his big young body was
demanding food.</p>

<p class='c006'>In his uniform he presented a figure to admire, as did
most of the young officers aboard. His back was broad,
his legs straight, and, though not bulky, gave one the
impression that he was graciously and strongly made.
One may read much from a man’s legs. More especially
is this so in uniform and leather puttees. Indications of
character are resident in a calf, but more especially in
knees and ankles. These things are concealed by the
trousers of civilian life. Some day an astute judge of
character will write a monograph on masculine legs and
revolutionize the appraisal of men. The captain’s legs
were a credit to the United States, the army, and himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was not handsome, nor was his face delicate with
overmuch intellectual labor. If you had met him in a
crowd you would have said immediately that here was a
young man who could play a bully game of football.
That was the impression his features gave—of ability to
play a rough game splendidly. It was not the face of a
pugilist nor of a society man. It was the face of an
average young American of the class which goes to college,
acquires enough education to make him easy in the
presence of gentlemen, and upon which to base a greater
success in life than had been possible to his father who
came before him. When you looked at him you thought
in physical terms before you considered his possible
mentality. There was nothing dull about him; there
were indications of a reasonable amount of good nature,
and some intolerance, and much of boyishness. His attention
was equally divided between France and biscuits.</p>

<p class='c006'>A young woman just in front of him turned and looked
up at him. “Here comes something,” she said, pointing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dirigible,” he replied, following the direction of her
finger.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dirigible buzzed out to the vessel, looked it over,
and evidently with satisfied mind turned and hurried
away toward shore again....</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s a convoy or something,” said the young
woman.</p>

<p class='c006'>The captain was interested. “Probably coastwise
ships coming down from England. Six of them, aren’t
there?... And see all those other little boats in there.
Must be close to the harbor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’re slowing down.... See, there’s that little boat
like a tug with a cannon up in front. It’s signaling us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pilot, probably.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The vessel lost headway and everybody watched the
pilot come aboard as if it were some strange phenomenon—as
it was to all but a few.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder if we’ll be allowed to cable home that we have
arrived?... What do you think, Captain Ware?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Haven’t the least idea in the world. Don’t see why
not, though, Miss Knox.... War Department ’tends
to it for us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My people will be terribly worried until they hear I
am safe, and then they’ll keep on being worried until
I’m back in New York again.... I’m going to sit down.
Come on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude Knox’s tone approached the proprietary, not
that she had asserted any permanent claim to Captain
Ware, but only those property rights <i>in transitu</i> which
arise even in war-time aboard a transatlantic liner. She
had promenaded with him, had played bridge with him,
and had sat out on deck—the lightless decks—with him
as other young men and women aboard ship had embarked
on friendly alliances for the voyage. These two had
talked, or rather Miss Knox had talked and Captain Ware
had listened, and rather liked each other—that was all.
There had been nothing sentimental in their relations,
even under the moon and in the not unromantic precautionary
darkness enforced by the peril of the submarine.
They were recognized by the passengers as having
paired off, just as a dozen other young couples were
similarly indulgently recognized. It was youth making
the best of its every moment. That was all.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I simply can’t imagine what it is going to be like—living
over here,” she said. “It must have been terribly
interesting for an American to live in France before the
war—but now, with all the effects of war to see, it will
be like living in a thrilling book, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ware had thought of France mostly in terms of war,
of ruined villages, lines of trenches, strategic positions.
The romance of going to war in France had not missed him;
he felt it, but he felt it with a vagueness, an ignorance of
what he was to find, and a chaotic conception of the
French people that, perhaps, but made the adventure
the more romantic to him. He was aware that something
great, something that was going to interest him as he had
never been interested before, was about to happen to him.
But what it would be like he could not picture, did not
try to picture. He knew he wanted to see Paris, because
he had heard tales of Paris. Most of them he was inclined
to discount, but enough remained to make him feel
that the city was well worth his investigation. That is
as far as he had thought of civilian France.... What his
thoughts and sensations were, now that he was nearing
those shores, he was unable to put into words, and if he
had been able the natural reticence of the young man
afraid of appearing sentimental would have caused him
to remain silent. Not so Maude Knox.</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude was the daughter of a professor of philosophy in
a Mid-Western university. From her babyhood she was
accustomed to the dissection of souls. She had seen her
own soul on her father’s mental operating-table, and,
somehow, the reserves which are inherent in the common
run of girls seemed to be what she called <i>piffle</i>. She had
grown up with her father and a housekeeper, and theories
and philosophies and iconoclasms had been the commonplace
staple of her mental diet. A great many of them,
too, she catalogued in her small head as piffle. On the
whole, she was a bit <i>queer</i>, or so her girl friends said, but
by no means unwomanly or otherwise than girlish. She
had a way of liking to look facts in the face, and of discussing
them critically. That made her queer. She liked
to talk about things, and inquire into things, and was
fairly capable of analysis. She fancied she knew a great
deal about life and the complexities of human conduct—because
she had heard them discussed and had discussed
them herself. Actually she was an exceedingly unworldly
young person, with more than the usual amount
of tolerance for the peculiarities of other folks.... She
was rather small, with hair that crinkled close to her head
and which no amount of breeze seemed ever to disarrange;
her eyes, when she laughed, closed to twinkling slits, and
tiny wrinkles ran out from their corners in a droll sort
of way; her cheek-bones were high, and her cheeks not
at all rounded. She was pretty, but she was also undoubtedly
<i>chic</i> and agreeable-looking.... She wore a
leather coat, and when she walked she thrust her hands
into the side pockets and strode with a swing of the
shoulders from side to side that was almost a boyish
swagger. One might have been excused for concluding
that she had only recently emerged from tomboyhood.
She had a certain confidence of bearing that was at once
attractive and a safeguard. There was something about
her which seemed to say to young men who looked at her
with interest, “No nonsense here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There are girls who are advertised by their appearance
as amenable to shaded porches, moonlit nights, and
sentimental interludes. Maude Knox was not one of
these. Yet she did not impress one as being exempt from
emotions and sensations; she gave no warning that one
must expect no warmth. It was rather that emotions,
sensations, warmth were there, but surely controlled, not
to be manifested lightly or frivolously. Somehow it was
easier to think of her as a wife than as a sweetheart....</p>

<p class='c006'>Ware was thinking how his father would enjoy all this,
the arrival in a strange land, the sights, the anticipation
of events to come. His mother would not have enjoyed
it. There was too much bustle and confusion for her,
too much to upset the nerves. In all likelihood she would
be confined to her cabin with one of those nervous headaches.... But
his father—his father was one of those
men who never grow beyond their enthusiasms nor beyond
naïve manifestations of their enthusiasms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” he said, in answer to Miss Knox, “the folks will
worry, of course.... Dad won’t worry so much, but
mother’ll be in a stew. She’s usually in a stew.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I had a <i>time</i> to get father to let me come. He said
a war was no place for a young lady.... But this seems
to be a different kind of a war, doesn’t it. Women are
going to it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can understand nurses....” he said, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But not the rest of us. That’s because you’re old-fashioned
and Middle-Western.... The army wouldn’t
let us come if we weren’t useful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, exactly, are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, ... <i>something</i>—something <i>useful</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s that girl that plays the harp, and a choir-singer,
and a couple of actresses. I can understand them
more or less, but you ... I really don’t. You’re not a
stenographer, nor anything like that, nor an entertainer,
nor a nurse, nor an ambulance-driver.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Maybe I’ll be a chaperon,” she said, taking refuge in
lightness, for she really did not know what she <i>was</i> going
to do. She was classified as a canteen worker. Her
uniform was that of the Y. M. C. A., and she had remarked
with feeling that the hat was already beginning
to fade....</p>

<p class='c006'>“I presume you know as much about it as any of us do....
I wish you could hear dad on the war and on
Germany. He reads the papers to the last punctuation
mark, but, somehow, he never seems to grasp it. Possibly
most folks are that way, but father always says what
he thinks, and goes ahead pronouncing the names of
French towns, and has opinions about everything. He
gets excited and pounds on the table.... Dad’s all
right. We’ve always done things together since I was a
kid. He’s that kind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was able to see that a very real affection for his
father was stated in those phrases. She wondered about
the father—if he resembled his son in appearance or
character.... He did not. The father was a middle-sized
man of no education except what an undirected
reading of many books had given him. He was a great
reader of novels, especially of historical romances, and his
knowledge of the past of the nations came from these.</p>

<p class='c006'>His idea of France was Athos, Porthos Aramis, and
d’Artagnan, with Miladi and a few cardinals and intriguing
duchesses thrown in.... He owned a grocery
in Detroit which did moderately well. His soul was filled
with admiration and love for his son. He had a temper
given to sudden, brief flashes ... and he had no bad
habits except that he chewed tobacco surreptitiously.
People liked him, especially children. He was good
personally, but had no vindictive attitude toward evil.
Every Sunday he went to church without complaint and
without thought of it; though he would have enjoyed
himself much more in a boat with a fish-line. When
Captain Ware was younger and got into difficulties which
his mother magnified into crimes and wept and foresaw
disgrace, Mr. Ware would say, “Now don’t you worry,
mother; that boy’s coming out all right....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother’s more worried about my coming to wicked
France than about my being shot up,” he said, presently,
and smiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>His mother was the dominant member of the family.
She was the last word in orthodoxy and was stubbornly
dogmatic. She was religious after the manner of a zealot,
but in her life economy took place just before religion.
One had to save money and be economical to enter the
kingdom of heaven; she could even overlook a few moral
lapses in an individual who was frugal and laid by systematically
for a rainy day.... All his life Captain
Ware had been afraid of pulling down on his head what
he privately called his mother’s “tantrums.” These were
hysterical outbursts following some escapade of his, or
possibly following a mere argument in which economy
or religion was mentioned. She could cast stinging
darts with her tongue, and when she was opposed, it did
not much matter where, she was reckless in dispensing
them. Anybody who stood near was likely to be wounded.</p>

<p class='c006'>But she loved her son savagely and jealously, and lived
her life and practised her economies for him. Anything
which appertained to the perpetuation of the species
was somehow abhorrent to her. Here, as everywhere,
she was an extremist. Before her son was ten years old
she was already in a state of mind, and embarrassed him
so that he exerted himself to avoid being alone with her,
by questioning him and by very frank warnings.... At
ten she gave him a book to read entitled <i>Plain Facts</i>.
She worked as she thought, frantically, without sparing
herself or anybody else ... and the result was that she
was burning herself out.... She was a remarkable
woman, sometimes a lovable and companionable woman,
but so intense, so intolerant of any belief which did not
agree perfectly with hers, that people always felt the
necessity of being on their guard with her so as not to
“set her off.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was from these parents that Captain Ware inherited,
and he was like neither of them.... But traces of both
were easy to find in him. When one looks for explanations
of his acts, one would do well to study his parents
and to see if his acts did not spring from inherited characteristics
and tendencies, or were not the result of a
revulsion against parental characteristics which had irked
him as a boy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, for the first time in his life—and he was twenty-six
years old—he was cutting loose from family contacts,
and cutting loose in this total and revolutionary manner.
His first adventure in freedom was into a new world which
would not understand him and which he was not equipped
to understand himself.... He had always lived at home,
except for his four years in college, and his mother’s figure
had been always present, for she had made it her business
to keep it ever present.... In a few hours he would set
his foot on the soil of France.... With one sudden
wrench, war had snatched him from an environment
dominated by his mother—and set him down in France.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder if we’ll get ashore to-night,” said Miss Knox.</p>

<p class='c006'>That question presently answered itself. After a short
progress up the river, the vessel dropped her anchor,
there to remain until morning.... That night Captain
Ware sat late on deck with Maude Knox, watching the
strange river thick with anchored craft which busied
themselves by sending flashing signals to each other—mysterious
signals that seemed to say: “You have arrived
at the war. We are busy about the war....”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Polish volunteers forward sang the weird songs of
their land; the Americans aft manifested their relief at a
safe arrival by wildly cheered boxing-bouts followed by
enthusiastic, if somewhat ragged, singing of many popular
songs.... There was a preference for that sentimental
type of song which had to do with weeping sweethearts
left standing on the pier, and with mothers dedicating
their boys to death for the flag....</p>

<p class='c006'>In the morning came the distress of customs examination
and the woes of finding and identifying baggage.
Ware assisted Miss Knox as other young officers were
assisting their partners of the voyage.... The vessel
tied up to the dock. Miss Knox shook hands and said
good-by, marching down the steep incline of the gangplank
with the members of her party.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder if I’ll ever see him again?” she thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for Captain Ware, the girl passed completely from
his mind. He had other things to think about and a
great curiosity to satisfy.... So far as he was concerned,
she had passed out of his life.</p>

<p class='c006'>He stood at the rail, looking down upon the wharf.
Below him an American soldier thrust his head out of a
port-hole, looked about him sternly, and then demanded of
a Frenchman below, “Say, mister, where’s all this trouble,
anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>His attitude was typical of those boys. There was
trouble some place and they wanted to get to it and
settle it with promptness. It was the attitude of a
policeman a little late at the scene of a fight....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall Ware arrived in Paris early on the evening of
May 19th and alighted from the crowded train in the
Gare d’Orléans. He was excited. It was impossible that
he should actually be in Paris, but he was unmistakably
there. It rather astounded him and he wanted to rush out
of the gray old station to see it at once.... To arrive in
Paris was a fitting climax for such a day as he was completing,
a day that had given him his first glimpses of
beautiful France, glimpses from a rapidly moving train
that had caused him to say to himself, “It’s no wonder
the French will fight for such a country.” Already he was
impressed by France; already admiration for it was beginning
to grow within him.... That beautiful, smiling,
rich, clean expanse of hills and fields and vineyards,
punctuated by little red-tiled villages and by ancient
sprawling stone farm buildings, had touched the sentimental
in him. He thought he understood why Frenchmen
love their land ... but he had not scratched the
outer husk of that reason yet. It would require weeks
for him to discover that it was not the material, not land
nor soil nor the structures reared by men, that caused
the Frenchman’s passionate love; it was, he would discover,
the imponderables, the immaterial—it was the
soul that resided in the material....</p>

<p class='c006'>He climbed the stairs from the train-shed into the
station proper, and paused a moment to regard with
boyish interest the crowd composed of women and soldiers,
of <i>poilus</i> carrying full equipment—sturdy little men
whose age seemed greater than it was by reason of four
years given to such affairs as Verdun, the Marne, the
battles in the Champagne. These men had been in it.
They had heard cannon roar with deadly intent; they
had taken part in charges and in retreats; the trench
and the dugout were more their homes to-day, through
years of custom, than their own farms or cottages....
They were <i>soldiers</i>, and they looked to be soldiers.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were uniforms of other nationalities, too: of the
British, the brown and tasseled caps of the Belgians, the
gray and peaked caps of the Italians—and the khaki of
Americans. There was a boy with an arm-band bearing
the letters M P, with which he was to become very familiar—the
everywhere present and remarkably efficient military
police of the American Army....</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently he was in the dark street. The darkness
came as a surprise to him until he recalled that Paris
nights slept under the constant threat of German <i>Gothas</i>.
The street lights—casting a dim-blue glow—were shaded
above so that no light might rise to tell hostile raiders
that a great city lay here.... Strain his eyes as he
would, he could not see Paris, only a vague hint of buildings
that might be palaces or warehouses, for all that he
could see.... He looked for a taxicab.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then it occurred to him that when he found a conveyance
he had scant language with which to direct the
chauffeur. He was going to the University Union, once
the Palais Royal Hôtel, now taken over by American
universities and colleges as both club and hotel for
American university men in the army.... A tiny taxicab
rattled up to the curb—all Paris taxicabs rattle in this
way—and he approached it with some embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“University Union,” he said to the chauffeur.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Comment?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“U-ni-versity Union,” said Kendall, speaking very
slowly and distinctly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Comment?</i>” repeated the chauffeur, waggling his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>Out of the crowd stepped a Frenchman, smiling.
“What is it monsieur desires? May I be of assistance to
monsieur?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I want to go to the University Union, and I don’t
know how to tell this man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The University Union? I do not know it. Is it that
it is an hotel, monsieur? Do you know its location?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall searched for a note-book and read the address.
“Number eight rue Richelieu,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Huit rue Richelieu</i>,” the Frenchman said to the
chauffeur.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you,” Kendall said, and took the hand which
the Frenchman extended cordially.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It makes nothing, monsieur. I am delighted to
serve <i>Monsieur l’Officier Américain.... Bon soir,
monsieur! Bonne chance!</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall’s heart was warmed by the little courtesy. It
was a sort of welcome to him. It surprised him, rather,
for in America one does not expect assistance to leap
to one from a crowd of strangers. He was soon to learn
that it was different in France; that all Paris seemed
to be on the lookout to be of service to American soldiers,
on the lookout almost to the point of embarrassment.
He was to discover that the heart of France had a very
special niche set aside for Americans. Even though it
had already a saying, “<i>Tous les Américaines sont fous</i>,” it
loved them for their very madness....</p>

<p class='c006'>The little taxi rattled and strained at breath-taking
speed around the corner, across the Pont Royale, under
the arches which allow a street to pass through the
Louvre (though he did not know it was the Louvre), past
the Comédie Française, and finally brought up with a
lurch before the building that had been the Palais Royal
Hôtel before the coming of the Americans.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here he registered, passed through a lobby filled with
American officers and sergeants and corporals and privates—for
in this one spot in all France military rank ceases
to exist and men are not soldiers, but university men—and
up-stairs to the Bureau of the University of Michigan....
In half an hour he was in a comfortable room with
windows which opened upon a balcony facing toward the
east.... He stepped out upon it and gazed into the
darkness. Scarcely a hundred feet away, across a narrow
street, was the dark bulk of a mammoth building, and the
black silhouettes of a multitude of quaint chimney-pots....
It was the ancient Royal Palace. Kendall did not
realize this, nor that his eyes were gazing at a spot rich
in history, in intrigue, in romance—and not unbaptized
with blood.... But one thing he knew—at last he was
in the heart of Paris....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Captain Ware felt singularly young, boyishly
exhilarated, as he walked out early next morning
for his first view of Paris. It was not yet eight o’clock,
but the day was beautiful, promising warmth; the skies
were clear; the whole appearance of things one of perfect
peace and quiet. The city did not seem one threatened
by war. The streets, as he walked up the rue de Rivoli,
were almost deserted. It was early for Parisians to be
abroad.</p>

<p class='c006'>The city astounded him, captivated him, gave him a
feeling of humility. He was familiar with Detroit, had
seen Chicago and New York, but Paris—Paris was different.
His experience gave him nothing with which to
compare it. Chicago and New York were unsightly
upheavals; the fantastic work of tremendous industrial
forces in irresistible motion. They reared. Paris did not
rear; it reposed; it had not been upheaved tumultuously—it
had been dreamed and dreamed by genius which
comprehended beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>The city affected him almost to breathlessness as it
opened before him when he passed the ancient grayness
of the Louvre. He turned to the left and stood between
the wide jaws of the Louvre, the mouth of the Place du
Carrousel, and, standing there, looked westward through
the reaches of the Tuileries and beyond to where, silhouetted
with massive grandeur, uprose Napoleon’s Arc de
Triomphe.... It was impossible—incredibly magnificent.
At that instant began the first great change in his life.
He might not consciously have dated it from that instant,
and possibly he never dated it at all, but Paris had set the
hand of her beauty upon him; her spell had touched him
with its magic.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why,” he said to himself, “anything could happen
here!” And presently, “The Germans drop bombs on
this ... they try to destroy this.”</p>

<p class='c006'>For the first time came an appreciation, not yet a full
appreciation, but far more than an inkling, that a great
event had overtaken him: he had left the Middle West
behind him; he felt that he was not only about to see,
but to be a part of, a new and wonderful mode of life and
of thought. There came to him a hint that there might
be something to life besides merely living it. Though
he did not know the phrase, he felt something of the
meaning it bears—<i>Joie de vivre</i>. Later he would, perhaps,
appreciate a remark made to him by a French
officer. “It is not <i>savoir faire</i> that is the great knowledge,
it is <i>savoir vivre</i>.” It is not so important to know how to
conduct oneself as it is to know how to make the most
of life....</p>

<p class='c006'>He retraced his steps to the rue de Rivoli, stopped to
regard the golden Jeanne d’Arc about which he said to
himself that he would have liked it better if it had been
bronze or marble, and that the sculptor had made Jeanne
“huskier” than he had pictured her to himself. That
was the word he used—“huskier.” Somehow he had
always conceived Jeanne d’Arc—what slight conception
he had of her—as rather anemic and thin and fragile....
His conception of Jeanne was like the conception many
good Americans have made for themselves of France.
Two millions of them would soon be on French soil to
see for themselves that it was not an anemic, fragile
country, but robust, healthy, capable not only of visions,
but of battles....</p>

<p class='c006'>He walked on to pause again in the Place de la Concorde
and to marvel at such prodigality of open space in the
very heart of a great city. He even tried to calculate to
himself the money worth of so many acres in the retail
section of New York, say along Fifth Avenue from
Thirty-fourth Street north and west.... It was a
typical American calculation. Beyond him the Champs
Élysées reached on, climbing its little gradient to the
Arc dc Triomphe. It was splendid and beautiful. It
“got under his skin,” as he phrased it.</p>

<p class='c006'>He stood there looking off across the river toward the
Chamber of Deputies, over the roof of which could be
seen the dome of Napoleon’s Tomb. Then he turned and
surveyed the path he had just traversed, that reach of low,
symmetrical buildings facing the Jardin des Tuileries.
He was not exactly inarticulate, but he was not eloquent.
“I’ll be damned,” he said under his breath. “Well, I’ll
be damned.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now he was hungry, and, walking more rapidly, he
returned to the University Union to find the dining-room
open and a few American officers at <i>petit déjeuner</i>. For
the most part they were eating bread and confiture and
washing it down with chocolate. A few were taking the
American breakfast, actually eating <i>two eggs</i> and other
food—a thing to convince the Parisian that these visitors
were indeed mad, or at least barbarians.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yea, <i>boy</i>!” said a loud voice, just as Captain Ware was
endeavoring to give his order to one of the two pretty
French girls who were the waitresses. It was his first
sight of the Parisienne, and it had rather surprised him.
They did not wear short skirts and high-heeled slippers,
with more than enough black-stockinged ankle to regard.
They had not saucy eyes and <i>rétroussé</i> noses, nor did they
whisk about flirtatiously. They were pretty, indeed they
were charming, but they were quiet, even subdued, and
they looked <i>nice</i>. That was a good American word he
could apply to them. He liked their looks, even if they
failed to come up to his ideas of what a French waitress
should be.</p>

<p class='c006'>He looked up from the pad on which he had been
checking off the <i>petit déjeuner</i>, to see facing him across
the table, in a captain’s uniform and Sam Brown belt
which made him almost unrecognizable, a man with
whom he had been more than friendly through four years
in Ann Arbor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert Stanley!” he exclaimed, jumping to his feet and
extending his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They all come here,” said Stanley to himself, “all of
them—if you just wait long enough.... When did you
land?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Day before yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And got to Paris so soon? How did you work that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ordered.... What are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Making marks on pieces of paper. That’s what I
got for knowing anything about architectural engineering.
I’m in the Signal Corps and I’m drawing plans for
aeroplane-sheds.... What are you?” He looked down
at Kendall’s collar markings.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Intelligence! I’m one of the fellows who find out
everything about everything in the world and tell it to
the army for its good.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stationed here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t know. Report this morning.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fix it, son, fix it.... It’s a great <i>guerre</i>, and this
battle of Paris—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Beurre, monsieur?</i>” asked the waitress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eh? What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She wants to know,” explained Stanley, with exaggerated
patience, “if you want butter. It’s extra.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall signified his desire for butter. “I’ve just been
out looking at the town,” he said. “The fellows that built
it knew what they were doing, didn’t they?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They knew how to do a lot of things. Staying here,
of course.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Didn’t know where else to go. You, too?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have been a month, but if I’m going to live here for
the duration, and it looks as if I were, I’d like to get
somebody and take a little apartment somewhere....
Over in the Quartier Latin or up on one of the streets
off the Étoile. Have some comfort. Live cheaper, too.
Get a cook for sixty or seventy francs, and be regular
people.... Say, if you’re set down in Paris, come on in
with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sounds reasonable,” said Kendall, tentatively.
“Haven’t the least idea what they’ll do with me, though.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, you run up and see, and, whatever happens,
meet me here at half past six and I’ll take you to a regular
place to eat, and then we’ll go out and look at the sights.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re on,” said Kendall, “bigger than a house.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Ware had hoped to be assigned to active duty
with a combat unit. He had studied and trained himself
for the duties of an intelligence officer at the front, and
for months had looked forward with enthusiasm to those
interesting and invaluable duties which such an officer
performs. He was not a young man to welcome a desk
job or to be contented with a position in the Safety of the
Service of Supplies region. In that he resembled thousands
of other young officers whose fortune it would never
be to hear a cannon fired in battle, to take part in a
charge, or to be nearer to the front than some small
town in the interior of France. None of them had
chosen their places. They had been sent where they were
most needed and where their work was essential to the
victories to be won against the enemy.... Captain
Ware, like these others, must perform the task set for
him, wherever it might lie—hoping always for a new
assignment that should carry him to the dugout and to
the trench. It was, therefore, with grievous disappointment
that he learned he was to be stationed in Paris,
apparently in permanence. He could still hope, for in
the army in France no man can tell what to-morrow will
bring him. Orders come and men go.... Somehow it
did not seem possible to him that he would thus go to
war without going to war; that he should journey across
the ocean to this mightiest of all conflicts without the
experience of battle....</p>

<p class='c006'>At half after six he was again at the Union, where he
found Bert Stanley waiting for him in the lounge, whiling
away the time very pleasantly in conversation with
charming Annette of the pert face, white teeth, and busy
chatter—a chatter made up in very large part of excellent
American idiom learned from the patrons of the cigar-and-candy
case of which she was custodian. Hundreds of
American officers will return to their country after the
war with pleasant memories of wise little Annette, the
little French girl who sold cigarettes and candy and wrist
watches and post-cards at the stand in the Union.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall ascended to his room in the queer little elevator
whose conductor was a tiny Belgian boy, proud of a few
words of American, and presently walked down the five
flights—for in France it is not considered good manners
in war-time to use an elevator for descent—and rejoined
Stanley.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” said Stanley, “what luck?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It looks like Paris for mine,” said Kendall, still depressed
by his disappointment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Might be worse.... Might have been Chaumont.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked north on the rue de Richelieu, past the
Molière fountain, and by the door of Marty’s which
Kendall was to know very well later on. At the rue
St.-Marc they turned to the left until the Opéra Comique
uprose before them, and then made their way into the
up-stairs dining-room of the Café Poccardi on rue Favart.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s early. The crowd doesn’t show up before seven-thirty,
so we can get a table up front where we can see the
show,” said Stanley. “Besides, there’s a waiter there
who speaks English.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They found seats with their backs toward the windows,
a point of vantage from which they could view the large,
mirrored room with its rows of small, closely set tables.
Only a few were occupied, but gradually the patrons
straggled in—a truly Parisian gathering. There were
handsome men in officers’ uniforms with many gold
service stripes on the sleeve, and some with two, three,
or even four wound chevrons on the opposite sleeve.
They were accompanied by well-dressed women, mostly
young, always very neat.... It was their shoes that
demanded Kendall’s attention. This was a matter that
had been impressing itself upon him through the day—that
the Parisienne knew how to dress her feet. There
were <i>poilus</i> on leave, each with his girl, or even with two
girls. There were one or two old but immaculate men
with women young enough to be their granddaughters.
A few women entered alone and seated themselves
quietly at tables to await their partners—perhaps the
café was their place of rendezvous.... Two women,
beautifully dressed in black, with widows’ veils, occupied
a table just across from Kendall and his companion.
They were very young, and one was remarkably lovely....
The sight rather depressed Kendall. This was one
of the meanings of war—this youthful widowhood! Here
was the cruelty of it, the bitterness of it!</p>

<p class='c006'>“France must be filled with widows,” he said to Stanley.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert grinned. “Camouflage,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you’re thinking about our friends opposite, don’t
get too sympathetic. They’re no more widows than I
am. Camouflage. It’s the style. But they’re overdoing
it. Everybody’s next, now, even us Americans.
Bait, sonny, bait, that’s what it is.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert looked over at the widows and smiled, and the
lovelier one smiled in reply, not brazenly, not with the
red-lipped, painted-cheeked smile of the Anglo-Saxon
siren, but demurely, pleasantly, as if she were merely
returning his smile out of courtesy and from an abundance
of gentle good nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See?” said Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But they look <i>nice</i>.” Again Kendall used that word.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are nice.... This isn’t Terre Haute, son.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Everybody was drinking wine, Kendall noticed. It was
universal, and as the meal progressed he spoke about it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Everybody is going to the wine,” he said, “but
nobody gets noisy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nobody does,” said Bert. “Do we get noisy at home
when we drink coffee?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall watched. He saw a man half fill his companion’s
glass with red wine, then pour in as much water
as there was wine. This, he saw, was almost universally
done.... Conversation was animated. There was
gay laughter and lightness, but it was not the gaiety of
wine.</p>

<p class='c006'>At a table well within view sat two <i>poilus</i> with their
wives or sweethearts. Kendall watched them, for it was
by far the jolliest, least restrained party in the room....
And then he saw the larger soldier throw his arm around
the neck of his buxom companion and kiss her soundly....
It rather shocked him. The idea of demonstrative affection
in, for instance, the dining-room of the McAlpin,
or in one of the better-class cafés of Detroit, was impossible
to entertain. He watched for a waiter to protest, perhaps
to eject the couple from the place.... But there were
only tolerant smiles when any notice whatever was taken
of the event.... And it was an event which was repeated—the
sound of hearty smacks coming even to
Kendall’s ear.... He saw other men come in, and
before they sat down beside waiting companions they
would stoop to salute with a kiss.... The thing was not
universal, not even general, but there was enough of it
for him to become aware that it was not exceptional....
But for all that, it made him feel embarrassed and uncomfortable.
Apparently, if people had kissing to do
they simply did it.... He was to recognize this later as
one manifestation of the frank, unaffected genuineness of
the people. Now it seemed rather gross to him, gross and
exotic. The idea did not occur to him then that it was he
with his American notions and antecedents, with his
inheritances from Plymouth Rock, that was exotic.</p>

<p class='c006'>He wondered who all these people were; he wondered
if they were <i>married</i>. Were these men and women husbands
and wives, or were the women those mysterious,
very French, somewhat exciting persons whom he had
read about in novels and who were called <i>mistresses</i>?</p>

<p class='c006'>He did not put the question to Stanley because he was
afraid of appearing provincial. He might as well have
done so, for in all probability Stanley, with all of his
month’s experience in Paris, was pondering the same
matter.... Anyhow, he felt that he was seeing life; that
he was beholding things which he could tell about later
to interested audiences.... It is a peculiarity of the
Anglo-Saxon mind that everything which is strange to it
appears to it as necessarily tinged with naughtiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>At another table, over to Kendall’s left, two girls were
eating alone, and he watched them with interest and
considerable curiosity, wondering who and what they
were. One of them attracted him particularly. She
was young, in the neighborhood of twenty, he judged.
She was dressed in white, a suit of some knit material
that reminded him of a light jersey, and on her very
black and wavy hair was a shapeless white cap of the
tam-o-’shanter variety. Her skin was a delightful
olive, and her eyes black, with shadows under them. She
was not beautiful, unless her eyes made her so. She
was small and almost thin. She addressed herself to her
food in a very business-like manner, not often looking up
from her plate, but once in a while she smiled as she
replied to some comment of her companion, and her teeth
were very white and regular. There was no appearance
of wealth about her, but every feature spoke of intelligence—indeed,
of a certain keenness.... She was very
attractive.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look,” he said to Bert. “I wonder who she is. She
looks as if she had ‘class.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pretty kid,” said Bert, who, just then, was more interested
in <i>poule au riz</i> than in Parisiennes.</p>

<p class='c006'>He continued to stare, unconscious of his rudeness, until
she lifted her eyes to his. For a moment she regarded
him, with no especial interest, certainly with no sign
which could be interpreted as provocative, and dropped
her eyes again to her plate.... Kendall was conscious at
once of disappointment and satisfaction. Here was another
girl that he had estimated as “nice,” and this time,
apparently, he was right.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a moment he heard her name, for her companion
uttered it. “Andree.” Somehow it suited her, Kendall
thought, and he thought, too, that it was a decidedly
pretty name ... “Andree.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From time to time, as he was finishing his dinner,
Kendall glanced at Andree. But he did not meet her
eyes again. She was not interested in him, apparently,
and even when he walked past her table on his way out
she did not look up or manifest by a sign that she was
conscious of his existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where now?” he said as they debouched onto the broad
Boulevard des Italiens.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Might as well take in the ‘Folies Bergère.’ It’s one
of the sights.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked along in silence, crossing the boulevard
and turning up a narrow street toward the theater. Kendall
continued to think about the little girl with the black
eyes. Somehow she had made an impression of some sort
upon him. He could not have described it nor estimated
it. All he knew was that he liked her looks immensely
and was curious about her. Probably he would never
see her again, but he found himself hoping that he might.</p>

<p class='c006'>They bought tickets for the “Folies” and entered,
traversing the large hall filled with tables at which the
audience was expected to refresh itself between the acts,
or even during the performance, and, after buying programs,
were conducted to their seats by a girl usher who
stood sternly by until she received her tip—a tip that she
would have suggested if it had not been tendered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the performance began—a very disappointing
performance to a Middle-Western young man who had
heard tales of the naughtiness of the French stage. It
turned out to be a rather clumsy musical comedy which
was more vaudeville than either music or comedy. It
was not naughty at all, he said to himself—but perhaps
that was because he failed to understand the dialogue.
Anyhow, he had seen much franker costumes and much
more suggestive incident in Mr. Ziegfeld’s “Follies” or
at the Winter Garden.</p>

<p class='c006'>The audience was more than half American; the music
was adapted from American shows, and between the acts
a jazz orchestra, “straight from Broadway,” made the
ears ring. Everybody got up between the acts and
promenaded or sat at the little tables.... Girls wandered
about and spoke to one, and made Kendall feel
uncomfortable and embarrassed again. He was glad
when they returned to their seats.</p>

<p class='c006'>The performance rather bored him, and he suggested
leaving. Bert was ready, too, so they sauntered out onto
the dark streets, making their way to the Avenue de l’Opéra
and past the huge bulk of that wonderful building which
France had erected even while she was paying to Germany
the billion-franc indemnity exacted after 1870. Once
or twice soft voices accosted them out of the darkness, but
they walked on toward the Union, and presently were
ordering ice-cream and listening to a lieutenant play ragtime
on the piano.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then, suddenly, the air was rent by a startling, metallic
shriek, a long-sustained, nerve-twanging, raucous blast.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Raid!” said Stanley, getting to his feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bomb raid?” asked Kendall, instantly excited.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. Let’s go out and take a look.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So, with characteristic foolhardiness, they sallied out and
hurried up the rue de Rivoli to the Place de la Concorde,
where they sat on a stone balustrade and waited. They
were not alone. About that open space were scattered a
dozen Americans impelled by absurd curiosity—a curiosity
they would discard very shortly and become more circumspect
in their behavior as well as more respectful
toward the <i>Gothas</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Still the <i>alerte</i> sounded, more terrifying than the sound
of the barrage which was presently to begin. Sirens
mounted on fire-engines were giving the alarm, tearing
madly through the black streets, and with horrid voice
commanding Paris to seek sanctuary in <i>abri</i> or in the
tunnels of the Metropolitan.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was not frightened; he was hardly apprehensive.
Even when the guns opened toward the north
and he could see bright star-flashes as shrapnel burst high
above, he was only exhilarated and very interested. The
thing did not seem serious to him. But it <i>was</i> serious,
he knew. It was war, and such barbarous war as held
the world in a spell of horror. Presently the air was filled
with the crashes of cannon, and one could trace the course
of the enemy by the spreading of the ring of fire about the
city.... Once in a while would come a deep, dull,
thunderous <i>boom</i>, as a bomb, released by a <i>Gotha</i>, would
fall in the distant suburbs, perhaps upon the home of
some laborer, burying himself with his wife and babies in
the ruins, or destroying them utterly so that no trace of
their human shell would ever be discovered.... The
firing moved westward, and then swung around to the
south as the hostile aeroplanes strove vainly to penetrate
the city.... This continued for half an hour. Then
there was a time of quietness, after which came the
pleasant voices of bugles notifying a cowering population
that all was clear.... The raid had been abortive—it
had succeeded in killing only half a dozen defenseless
civilians!</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall and Stanley walked back to the Union—to
have another dish of ice-cream. As they walked up-stairs
in the darkness Kendall said to his friend: “I wonder
who that girl was ... the one in the restaurant. Her
name was Andree.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall Ware had been two weeks in Paris; he
had learned many things, absorbed many things,
but as his observations grew he discovered depths to his
ignorance that were not apparent to him on the day of his
arrival. The greatest advance he made in those first
weeks was in arriving at a knowledge of how little he
understood or was equipped to understand of France—and
when he said <i>France</i> he did not mean a country, but
the people who inhabited the country. Continually he
was amused by superficialities; daily he was impressed by
profundities. Gradually he came to perceive that one
cannot know France by looking at the surface any more
than one can gather a knowledge of what is transpiring
in the ocean by sailing a little boat over its waves.</p>

<p class='c006'>A people which can produce Joan of Arc and Robespierre,
a St. Louis and a Louis the Eleventh, a Madame Roland
and a Madame du Barry, a Clemenceau and a Calliaux;
which is capable of an 1870 and of a 1914, of the Terror and
of Verdun—is not one whose complexities can be solved
by a twenty-six-year-old American in fourteen days.... The
American will make no impression on France, but
France will make a profound impression on the American.</p>

<p class='c006'>From being interested in a city, in its buildings and its
beauties, Kendall became interested in its people.</p>

<p class='c006'>His first reaction to the people was rather romantic.
He saw romance in every one. Hotel porters with one
arm, wearing the Croix de Guerre and the Légion d’Honneur,
and perhaps the Médaille Militaire excited him.
Each one was, in truth, a hero. These men had seen and
done. Now they worked at menial tasks, still wearing
uniforms, and with those medals on the breast which
raised them into the aristocracy of manhood. It was
strange to him that a man could be at once an honored
hero and a porter.... <i>Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité</i> were
inscribed on every public building. This was one of the
manifestations of Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood. These
things really existed, and so a porter could be a decorated
hero.</p>

<p class='c006'>If one addressed a taxi-driver one called him <i>Monsieur</i>,
just as if one were addressing the President of the Republic
itself. One addressed the <i>gendarmes</i> as <i>Monsieur</i>. One
addressed even the turbaned and besashed and betrousered
Moroccan street-sweepers as <i>Monsieur</i> if one addressed
them at all. Monsieur Poincaré or Monsieur Clemenceau
would have given them the same salutation. It was not
an affectation; it was not what strangers have called
French politeness. It was but a manifestation of Liberty,
Equality, Brotherhood. At first it had seemed rather
absurd to Kendall, American and republican though he
was, but he grew to like it, and somewhat to understand it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Everywhere he saw heroes wearing medals. It made
him feel insignificant and somehow lacking. One could
not walk a block without passing officer or <i>poilu</i> with the
red ribbon of the Legion of Honor, or the rarer, even more
precious, broad yellow stripe of the Military Medal.
The narrow green stripe of the ribbon of the War Cross
was everywhere. Sometimes the ribbons were elongated
to give space to two or three, or, as was the case with
one boyish officer, to eight palms.... And every palm
the token that its bearer had fought back out of the clutch
of Death, performing some act of valor which raised him
above the level of an army of heroes....</p>

<p class='c006'>These soldiers were the first to command Kendall’s
interest, but it expanded to cover every one. Ancient
drivers of <i>voitures</i> whose horses were always too tired to
take him where he wanted to go; the chauffeurs of taxi-cabs
who could never understand his French, and who,
when he had made them understand, told him they could
not take him to his destination because they happened to
be heading the other way; the crowds who occupied the
tables under the awnings on the sidewalks of the rue de la
Paix or the rue Royale; the old women who came to
collect two sous if one took a seat along the Champs
Élysées or the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne; the soldiers,
French, Belgian, Italian, Austrian, Canadian, English,
Moroccan, American, who promenaded of evenings and
Sundays from the Place de la Concorde to Rond-Point,
and the girls with whom they promenaded—all these interested
him, and each, as he studied them with boyish
<i>naïveté</i>, added something to his education.</p>

<p class='c006'>He worked hard by day, and often far into the night,
but for the most part his evenings were free to investigate
life with Bert Stanley, whose investigations were merely
of the surface and were rather questings for an hour of
amusement.... Sometimes he played bridge with three
other Americans at the Union, but he liked best to stroll
about the darkened streets, without object or destination.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little by little he added to his meager store of the
language. When he spoke to friends about securing an
instructor they laughed at him. “Pick it up.... Talk
to people,” they told him. “Sit down on a bench along
the Champs Élysées and talk to a girl. They’re as eager
to learn English as you are French.... It’s better than
a teacher—and a darned sight more pleasant.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He voiced his distaste for this suggestion. He had been
but two weeks in Paris, and very mistakenly had classified
all the girls who promenade the Champs Élysées in the
evening as women of the streets. His natural decency
revolted at any contact, no matter how slight, with these.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nine out of ten of those little girls work in shops or
offices,” Bert told him. “You haven’t got ’em right, son.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Kendall was suspicious. He continued in that
attitude until one evening a little girl—she appeared not
more than seventeen—sat rather diffidently on the other
end of his bench.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good night, monsieur,” she said, with quaint pronunciation.</p>

<p class='c006'>He did not answer, but turned his back with a gesture
of repulse.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, monsieur, please,” she said, timidly. “I am not a
bad girl.... See.” She turned her face so that the
dim light shone upon it and pointed to her cheeks. “There
is not paint. You see. No.... I am a good girl, but
monsieur, I am—how do you say <i>solitaire</i>? I learn
English.... It will not harm monsieur if I talk with him
a little and learn English.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall regarded her. She was a little thing with
clear eyes and a rather pretty face, whose cheeks, as she
pointed out, were guiltless of paint. She was not well
dressed, though she was neat, <i>chic</i>. And she was so
young.... It was apparent to him that she told the
truth, and his manner changed toward her.</p>

<p class='c006'>They talked. It was a conversation which would have
aroused the mirth of a listener ... but it was remarkable
how well each made the other understand; she with
slowly pronounced French and a few words of quaint
English—he with his small stock of atrociously articulated
French.... She worked in a chocolate-shop. She was
a refugee from Soissons and an orphan. Her two brothers
had been killed at Verdun and her mother and father had
died of the war.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now I must make to work,” she said, simply. “But
I am very <i>solitaire, monsieur.... Oui, je suis
trés-solitaire—trés-solitaire</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor kid!” said Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>She shrugged her shoulders and said, with that calm
resignation which is so much to be met with, “<i>C’est
la guerre....</i> It is the war.” That is a phrase which
explains everything, excuses anything in France to-day.
“<i>C’est la guerre.</i>” One offers it to explain the lateness of
trains, the price of cheese, poverty, the lack of sugar,
morale, everything great or small. “<i>C’est la guerre</i>” is
the countersign of the epoch. It embraces everything.</p>

<p class='c006'>After an hour she arose, offered her hand charmingly,
and said good night and “<i>Merci</i>.” Kendall sat looking
after her, feeling the first life movements of a comprehension
of the womankind of France. From that moment
they assumed a higher place in his thoughts, not yet so
high as they deserved, but one rung nearer to the truth.
He did not even begin to understand them—not their
philosophy of life nor their conception of the relations
between the sexes; but he began to ask himself questions
to which his education and prejudices and narrownesses
could provide no answer. He began to wonder if all he
had heard were true; he began to consider, if it were true,
was it then necessarily evil. He had been brought up
to regard the drinking of any beverage containing alcohol
as inherently wicked and as something to be done surreptitiously
and with a sort of “devilish” feeling. Here
everybody drank wine, and wine contained alcohol, and
they did it with no concealment and with no thought
that it could be other than normal and perfectly respectable.
He considered that, and from it attempted to form
a judgment of other things which to him seemed not as
they should be. Apparently drinking in France was not
a thing of moral turpitude, done as it was done by the
French.... Perhaps, then, other matters were the same:
evil in Detroit because custom and inherited moral conceptions
had made them so; right in Paris because custom
and inherited moral conceptions had made them so....
Dimly he was feeling for the conception that an act in
itself is not a sin, but the manner of the performance
of that act.... This may have been sophistry; it may
have been alarmingly faulty moral philosophy, but it
marked a step ahead for a young man come of such
parentage as Kendall came of. It marked a willingness
to listen to argument and to maintain an open mind. His
mother, he considered, had never maintained an open
mind. She had been dogmatic. To inquire into things
was a sin to her. Nothing had been so quick to arouse
her anger as an impulse on his part to look for the reasons
of things, particularly religious things.... His father
had not been like this. True, he had not been of an
inquiring turn of mind, but he had seen no especial reason
why somebody who wanted to inquire should not be allowed
to do so. There was a certain sweetness about
his father, a tolerant attitude toward life in general and
toward transgressions in particular, that came nearer to
the attitude of Jesus Christ than did the hard, unbending,
dogmatic almost cruel religion of his mother.... He had
inherited from both parents; each had given him something
distinctly traceable to each, and both had joined
to give him other qualities which were a strange composite
of both of them. He was inclined to judge at first sight
like his mother, harshly and dogmatically; he was inclined,
on second thought, to look for excuses and to forgive
what must be judged as evil, like his father. It was
a quality composite of the characters of his parents that
he placed the abstraction of <i>goodness</i> on a lofty throne,
but was inclined to apply its laws with gentleness and
mercy rather than with narrowness and hardness....
There were days when he was inclined to narrowness and
dogmatism; there were days when he bent quite in the
other direction and became over-indulgent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Following his first experience in conversation with a
casually encountered girl, and finding himself to have come
off none the worse for it, he repeated the experience
several times, and enjoyed it, and came to look forward
to the evenings because of the possibility of a pleasant
and instructive talk with some girl he would never see
again, but from whom he would learn some French and
considerable of France.... It was rarely that his sense
of propriety was offended or that the attitude of one of
his chance companions was other than “nice.” He made
no effort to follow up any of these casual meetings, or to
centralize his attention upon a single girl. He preferred
matters as they were. But he was learning that the
ordinary French girl did not resent being accosted by an
American, and that when he was lonely he might find
charming company without fear of being rebuffed.</p>

<p class='c006'>On his third Sunday in Paris he was sitting among the
trees that border the Champs Élysées. He was lonesome,
for Bert Stanley had been absent on a mission for
several days. He and Bert were sharing a room at the
Union now, a room with two beds, which cost them
jointly ten francs a day—and he missed Bert. He had
lunched alone that noon and now did not know what to
do with himself. It was the first time he had been
really homesick, but now he was homesick and uneasy and
rather at loose ends. He wished something would happen;
that some friend would appear with an entertaining suggestion.
So he sat and smoked and watched the passage
of the colorful crowd.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently he stiffened to interest. In the distance he
saw approaching a girl dressed in white. It was the
white tam-o’-shanter that had caught his eye. It was
familiar. For a moment he could not remember where he
had seen it, or why it stirred him to interest, and then he
recalled the little girl of the Café Poccardi. He even remembered
her name—“Andree.” She came abreast of
him and he identified her certainly. It was she, and
really more attractive than he had remembered her to be.
She walked along with little steps, her body very straight,
her bearing very staid. As she walked her eyes remained
straight in front of her, as though her mind were on
some interest at her destination.... Her profile was prettier
than his first picture of her full face had been; there was a
daintiness about her lips and her straight little nose, and
about the whole of her. If one had been compelled to
limit himself to a single word in describing her, he would
have been forced to use that word “dainty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She passed, and his eyes followed her. Suddenly he
stood up with a resolution half formed, a resolution to
speak to her. Then he hesitated. She did not look like
a person one speaks to without permission or presentation.
But it was a chance.... He was lonely and this was
rather an adventure, and, besides, he had learned that one
is not often rebuffed when making a casual advance.
Still Kendall was a bit apprehensive. He walked along
behind her irresolute, wondering if he dared, and keying
up his courage to dare. At any rate, he would wait until
they were out of the crowd; he did not wish the embarrassment
of being rebuffed too publicly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The girl tripped along, almost birdlike in the carriage
of her head and in the <i>ensemble</i> of her daintiness. At the
Place de la Concorde she turned to her left up the rue
Boissy d’Anglas, on one corner of which is the Hôtel
Crillon and on the other a high, blank wall of brick.
The street was deserted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall summoned his resolution and overtook her as
she entered the shadow of the brick wall. He was rather
excited and apprehensive, and stammered a bit as he
lifted his hat and said in his best French, “<i>Bon jour,
mademoiselle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She stopped suddenly and slowly raised her eyes to his
face. She was not startled, not frightened, not thrown
from her poise in the least.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Bon jour, monsieur</i>,” she said, with a rising inflection,
as one who expresses surprise and inquiry.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was at a loss. He did not know how to proceed
or how to make plausible his action. What little
French he knew departed from him, and he stood awkwardly
by her side, feeling very idiotic indeed. She
waited gravely, with no twinkle in her eye at the rather
absurd figure he must have presented.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Voulez-vous promenade avec moi?</i>” he managed to
articulate, at last.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>Why? Why should she promenade with him? He felt
his face reddening, and it was his impulse to clap on his
cap and beat a hasty retreat. What answer was there to
that <i>why?</i> He could think of nothing whatever to say,
and the pause became awkward.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Parlez-vous anglais?</i>” he asked, desperately.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>In sheer desperation he touched her arm and began
walking. She walked with him, the merest hint of an
amused smile at the corners of her mouth.... At any
rate, she was walking with him. That much was accomplished,
but, now that he had progressed to this
point, what was he to do with her? She was difficult, and
not inclined to help him in the least.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle,” he said, desperately, “I speak very
little French. I am very lonesome.” Then, of necessity,
he lapsed into his own tongue. “Why in thunder don’t
you speak English!” he said, testily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where are you going?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“With you—if you permit,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again that appalling why. He was to come to know
that she used it often; that she shot it at one like an unexpected
little arrow when one least looked for it, and
rather upset one with it. There came a time when he
called her Mademoiselle Pourquoi because of this. “Because—”
he answered. “Because— Oh, confound it!
I don’t know why. I haven’t any idea. No reason at
all. I just want to.... Now if you could only understand
that we might get somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was amused—a little. She regarded him gravely,
and it was apparent that she was appraising him, satisfying
herself as to what sort of a barbarian he was, and
possibly as to what he had in mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you dine with me?” he asked. That was a
phrase he had by heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Same reason,” he said, ruefully, in English. “I’ve
got to dine, you’ve got to dine, we’ve got to dine....
<i>Pourquoi, pourquoi, pourquoi—toujours vous dit pourquoi.</i>”
This was not remarkably excellent French, but she comprehended,
and for the first time she uttered a little
laugh. He amused her. From that moment they got
along better, for, apparently, she had appraised him as
not dangerous.</p>

<p class='c006'>She began to ask questions, not idly, he judged, but
the better to satisfy herself about him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He told her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are an American?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“From what city?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Detroit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know it.... What is your grade?” She
meant his military rank.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Captain.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you married?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He had rather been expecting that question, for it had
been put to him by almost every girl he had talked to.
Apparently it was an important question.... In a land
where so many, many young men have been sacrificed to
war an unmarried man is an important personage. He
offers possibilities. Suppose that one million, two millions
of men of marriageable age have been slaughtered,
there remain at home one or two millions of young
women who have no one to marry. This, in France, is
not a theory, but a condition, a very real and very terrible
condition. A million girls of an age for marriage and
no men!...</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was silent while they walked the greater part of a
block. He repeated again his well-learned phrase, “Will
you dine with me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, in the tone of one making a decision
of some moment. “Where?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anywhere you wish.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They were just passing a little café not distant from the
Madeleine, and she stopped hesitatingly, rather speculatively,
and there was a subdued twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was looking for information about this young
American, and this was an experiment. The cafe was
one of the most expensive in Paris, and doubtless Andree
wanted to see how he would act at her suggestion, for
reckless spending of money is a thing which your
Parisian does not indulge in. Possibly she wanted to
find out just how much she attracted him, and one way
to do it was to discover if he was willing to spend money
on her. It is not impossible that she wondered a bit if
he had lots of money, as all Americans are said to do.
Your Frenchwoman is not mercenary, but she is practical—and
lots of money is an excellent thing to have.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right,” he said, in perfect innocence, for he had
never seen the place before. It looked rather dingy and
not especially attractive. It was very small. So they
went in. There was a passage down the middle of the
room, with tables on either side, set in solid rows. The
waiter moved a table out to admit Andree to the leather
bench which ran along the wall. Kendall waited for the
table to be replaced so that he could sit across from her,
American fashion, but she motioned for him to sit by her
side. Young women and men in France sit side by side,
not <i>vis-a-vis</i>—and it is a custom not without its advantages.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ordering was a difficult matter, first because of lack of
the language, and second because he was beginning to be
very anxious to please this girl and to make a favorable
impression on her. With characteristic American generosity
or love of displaying his willingness to spend, he
would have ordered more than four could have eaten,
but she interfered and took the ordering into her own
hands—a thing for which he was grateful when the
check was presented.... Even when she was making an
experiment she could not bear to see money actually
wasted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall studied her covertly. She impressed him as
being a grave, very self-possessed young person. The
word demure conceals in its meaning something of the
provocative. If it were possible to remove that shade
of meaning from it, then it would have described Andree
exactly. She was demure without being provocative....
And how pretty she was. She grew on one. Those
heavily shadowed eyes were really beautiful, and her lips
delicately sweet. He made up his mind that she was
what he had been accustomed to designate as a lady,
which was but another way of saying “nice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Out of the corner of his eye he watched her eat. She
was very dainty about it, but also very interested.
Indeed, she ate in a thoroughly business-like manner,
giving her attention fully to her plate. He thought of a
bird. Indeed, there was something birdlike about her,
but what bird she resembled Kendall could not determine.
Possibly it was a composite resemblance.... He liked her
very much, but was puzzled by her. She was something
quite outside his experience. Her manner puzzled him.
She was not what he would have called “offish.” She did
not seem wholly at her ease, yet she was much more so
than he. She was gravely expectant; concealing herself,
perhaps, while she waited for self-disclosure on the part
of Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>She would drink but a fraction of a glass of wine and
declined a cigarette at the end of the meal.... Then he
called for the check and discovered that the rather light
repast was to cost him seventy francs. He wondered if
Andree were accustomed to eating seventy-franc meals,
not knowing that this was the first experience of the kind
she had ever had. Seventy francs would have sufficed
nearly for her food for a month.... On the whole, she
was a mystery to him, and as long as he knew her she
continued to remain something of a mystery. He was
incapable of solving her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now what shall we do?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We shall walk,” she replied, in quaintly stilted and
accented English. The effect was charming.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eh?” said Kendall. “You—why, you said you
didn’t speak English!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, and smiled, but offered no explanation.
But the explanation was clear, even to Kendall. It was
because she was making no admission whatever about
herself in those first few minutes. It was because she was
on the brink of a new experience, was meeting her first
American, and because she wanted to find out as much
as she could about him without permitting him to learn
anything whatever of her—until she was ready to permit
it.... He was pleased. Evidently her judgment was
favoring him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s fine,” he said. “Now you can teach me French
and I can teach you English.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Maybe,” she said, with her reserved smile. “We
shall see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s take a taxi out to the Bois de Boulogne,” he
suggested.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is very expensive.... It is not <i>nécessaire</i>. No,
we shall walk.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They retraced their steps to the Place de la Concorde
and walked slowly up the Champs Élysées to the Étoile,
and then diagonally to the left and so along the Avenue
du Bois de Boulogne, that wonderful promenade so dear
to Parisians. There they found chairs beside the broad
graveled walk and seated themselves. They had progressed
very well conversationally, for, though Andree’s
English was but little more extensive than Kendall’s
French, the two supplemented each other splendidly.
A little pocket dictionary which Kendall always carried
worked wonders. The little dictionary was a splendid
thing, anyway. It grew to be a little joke between them
and they laughed over it gaily; Andree became less
restrained.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall would start a sentence in French and arrive at
a point impassable. Neither English nor French could
supply his meaning. “<i>Attendez</i>,” he would say, with
mock solemnity, and then would produce the little book,
and with heads close together in the dusk they would
search it for the word. When they found it Andree
would laugh at Kendall’s pronunciation of it.... The
dictionary was a great promoter of acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was more and more curious about her. He wanted
to know who she was, and what she did, and if she worked
for her living, and where she lived, but he could not screw
up his courage to direct questions, and she volunteered
nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally she said, “I must be at my home, for every day
I have very much work.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you work at?” he asked, brashly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must study. Many, many hours every day I must
study.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are you studying?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Many things.... I must study much, much, for the
time is not long.... So I must be at my home <i>now</i>.”
She pointed down at the ground with a pretty gesture, a
childish gesture, the first manifestation of the sort she
had shown him. “I must be at my home <i>now</i>—at this
minute. Make me to be there—instantly.” Then she
laughed gleefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>What a charming little thing she was, he thought, and
was enchanted by her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Nous cherchons un taxi</i>,” he said, trying out his
French. Apparently he did reasonably well, for she
shook her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not <i>nécessaire</i>. No, I shall go on the Metro....
Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But—oh, now listen. I’m to go home with you, of
course. And we must see each other often—to learn
French and English, you know.... You’re not going to
send me away now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She considered a moment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may come with me—<i>some</i>.... When I say, then
you shall tell me good night. Do you promise?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” he said, “but—”</p>

<p class='c006'>She arose and he accompanied her to the nearest
station of the Metropolitan, into which they descended,
he very curious to know where they were proceeding, and
entered a passageway labeled “<i>Direction Châtelet</i>.” The
train was crowded and there was little opportunity for
speech until they changed to take another subterranean
train which discharged them at Place St.-Michel—the
heart of the Quartier Latin.</p>

<p class='c006'>So, Kendall thought, she is a student and she lives in
the Latin Quarter! There was magic in that thought,
romance in it; the very fact of her residence in that
fascinating quarter of the city gave her a higher valuation.</p>

<p class='c006'>They entered the big lift which should have carried
them to the street, but the lift declined to rise. They
waited amid bursts of laughter from the crowd, and then
everybody marched off again in perfect good nature—indeed,
rather delighted at a little adventure, for the old
soldier who operated the elevator had dined too well that
Sunday evening, and in his abounding good spirits had
forgotten how to operate his machine. The crowd
trudged up-stairs, laughing, not at all peevish as an
American crowd in like circumstances would have been;
indeed, they were rather in sympathy with the old
fellow. Just as they arrived at the top of the stairs the
elevator came slowly into view, the conductor stepped off
with the air of one who had done a noteworthy thing.
He removed his hat and bowed low to the company.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Regardez!</i>” he said, magnificently. “<i>Voilà....
Voilà!</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree laughed prettily and Kendall laughed, and they
were advanced another step in their acquaintance by the
little incident.</p>

<p class='c006'>The streets were black as they emerged, and Andree
took his arm, leading him diagonally across the Place,
past the fountain, and up the Boulevard St.-Michel—the
“Boul’ Miche” of fable and story. She permitted him
to accompany her for a few blocks, then she halted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is here you must go,” she said. “You must go
now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your promise!”</p>

<p class='c006'>He acquiesced. “I shall see you again?” He essayed
the thing in French, “<i>Voulez-vous donnez moi un rendez-vous,
mademoiselle?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no, no, no. It is not so. Écoutez. The right
way to say is this, <i>Voulez-vous me donnerai un rendez-vous?</i>
It is the future time, do you onderstan’?... You wish
to see me again?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle Pourquoi.” It was the first time he
called her so.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a liberty, perhaps, but it pleased her, for she
gave a little laugh. “You really wish to see me
again?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, really.... I want to see you—to beat the
band.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To beat the band?... What is that, monsieur? I do
not onderstan’, oh, I do not onderstan’.” She had a
way of failing to understand with despair in her voice
and her gestures that was very charming.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>L’argot américain</i>,” he explained. “American slang.
It means I want to see you very much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When?... To-morrow? <i>Demain?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot to see you to-morrow, for I must work, as I
said. <i>Mais</i> in the evening, yes. <i>Sept heure et demi.</i> Do
you onderstan’? In the Place St.-Michel, <i>près de la
fontaine</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At half past seven near the St.-Michel fountain....
And you will be there—<i>certainement</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Oui—et vous?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Certainement</i>—surely—you bet,” he said, with increasing
emphasis.</p>

<p class='c006'>She held out her hand. “<i>Bonne nuit, monsieur.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good night, mademoiselle.... To-morrow evening at
half past seven.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, and disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall stood a moment looking after Andree until
the blackness of the boulevard swallowed her up.
He was exhilarated. The girl had had a tonic effect upon
him; the incident was not an incident, but an adventure,
and he tingled with it.... He wondered why. He
wondered why he wanted to see her again when he had
not cared whether or not he saw again any of the other
girls he had talked to. He hoped she would appear
next evening as she had promised ... and then he felt
a twinge of apprehension. The twinge was not an inheritance
from his father.</p>

<p class='c006'>If he did see her again—then what? Would he see her
again and still again, and what were the meetings to lead
to? What sort of affair was he getting mixed into?...
He felt a sense of naughtiness, and, when he tried to discover
why he should feel naughty, he was unable to say.
Certainly there had been nothing in the least to warrant
it in any word or action of the evening. But Andree
was French—and she lived in the Latin Quarter....
What <i>was</i> he getting himself into, anyhow?</p>

<p class='c006'>The part of his being inherited from his mother was
in the ascendant. She suspected anything she did not
understand. Because she did not understand it she
believed something wicked must lurk in it somewhere....
He remembered how he had once dug a cave in a
vacant lot next his home and how his mother had almost
gone into one of her “tantrums” over it. She could not
understand why a boy should want to burrow into the
earth. It must be some squalid desire for wicked concealment
on her son’s part. She almost convinced him that
it was a sin for a boy to dig a cave, just as she had almost
succeeded in making him believe that so many of his other
perfectly natural desires and impulses and doings were
wicked.... She had a way of connecting everything
with <i>sex</i>, and she suspected <i>sex</i> above everything else in
the world. It was her nightmare. It was a squalid,
wicked sort of a thing, to be thought of only in terms of
aversion. Always she had hammered this into him, and
though he could not quite believe her, he never quite
outgrew her point of view. In this moment he knew
exactly how she would regard his meeting with Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then his father came to his rescue—his father, whose
dominant note was tolerance and a sweet inability to see
evil, or, if he saw it, to see palliation of it, or even a
vein of goodness running through it. His father never
suspected anything or anybody. His father had never
suspected <i>him</i>. Somehow that had always been very
wonderful to him, because his mother had impressed it
upon him that he was a person always under suspicion.
He knew exactly how his father would regard Andree and
what he would say and do. He could hear his father saying
it and see him doing it. His father would have patted
Andree on the shoulder and smiled. He would have said,
“She’s a pretty little thing, isn’t she?” Then he would
have proposed taking Andree and his son for an ice-cream
soda. His father always did that—for ice-cream soda or
candy. And then he would have whispered in Kendall’s
ear: “Got enough money, son? ’Cause if you hain’t—”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall wondered if it were better to see wickedness in
everything and sometimes to be justified by finding it, or to
see wickedness in nothing at all, and sometimes to be
disappointed by having it suddenly thrust upon one.</p>

<p class='c006'>He walked slowly toward the Place St.-Michel and
there descended into the Metro. His antagonistic inheritances
struggled within him, and his youth and his
youthful desire for the joys of life took sides with his
father. In one moment he determined he would never
see Andree again, and then he would call himself an idiot
and ask what harm could possibly come from it.... If
ever he had seen a “nice” girl, Andree was nice. Well,
then?... But he was disturbed, and had not been able
to conquer his disturbance when he entered the Union.
There he found Bert Stanley waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here comes the wicked old man,” Bert saluted him.
“What you been up to, with me away? Have I got to
keep my eye on you every minute?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just walking around,” said Kendall. Some young
men would have wanted to tell about Andree and to
discuss her, but not he.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s split a bottle of beer.... Say, I heard about
an apartment to let—up near the Étoile. What say to
having a look at it to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How much?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I heard it was three hundred francs—and we’re paying
that much here for one room with two beds.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sounds good, but I don’t know. Anyhow, we can
look it over.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“’Tisn’t far from the office. We can walk over at noon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall yawned. “Let’s go to bed,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s the use? There’ll be an air raid to-night.
Better to sit up than just to get nicely asleep and have
to roll out. I never get to sleep again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall persisted and walked up to his room, where he
was soon in bed, but not to sleep. He was excited and
restless. He wanted to sleep, not to think, but his mind
persisted in its activity, and his thoughts became incisive,
whitely clear as one’s thoughts do of sleepless nights. It
was rather the sensation of being subjected to a blinding
light which hurt the brain.... It was not alone of
Andree that he thought. He could concentrate on nothing,
but kept running down <i>cul-de-sacs</i> of memories and
speculations and plans which overlapped and confused
one another maddeningly. He would shut his eyes and
try to curtain off his mind so that no thought could
penetrate, but it was not to be done, so he tossed and
rolled and submitted.... Just around the corner of
every avenue his thoughts followed Andree, lay in wait.
Before he knew it he was building air-castles about
her....</p>

<p class='c006'>It was really a relief to him when the <i>alerte</i> sounded.
He said to himself that he would not get up, and composed
himself to wait. In a quarter of an hour the barrage
started, sporadically at first, then worked itself up to a
fury of sound such as he had never heard before. It
sounded nearer, more menacing. Really, cannon might
have been going off in the street below his window. So
imminent did the sound become that Kendall got out of
bed, not frightened, exactly, but impressed. He considered
that there was nothing above his head but the
roof. Half determined to dress and go down, he fumbled
for the light-button and turned it before he remembered
that there would be no light, that all light was turned off
at its source with the sounding of the <i>alerte</i>.... In his
pajamas he went to the windows which opened out on the
little balcony which overlooked the Palais Royal, and
stood there looking off toward the east, where the firing
was most furious.... Over his head he could hear the
angry humming of aeroplanes, and wondered uneasily
if they were defenders or hostile bombers. Tremendous
detonations rattled the windows and rocked the buildings,
and these, he fancied, were falling bombs. The sky was
alight with up-leaping flares from the mouths of the
cannon and from shells bursting high above the city,
searching the heavens for flitting <i>Gothas</i>.... Then came
a series of tremendous upheavals which seemed to his
tingling nerves to be almost at hand.... And then the
sky was red with flames which uprose and spread and
glanced and billowed over the tops of the buildings.
Metallic fragments rattled on the roof of the Palais
Royal, fifty feet away, and on the roof of his hotel and in
the streets below. Kendall ducked inside, for he knew
this was falling shrapnel from the defensive barrage....
For the first time he was seeing a real air raid, a serious
raid, and one that was meeting with success. Already a
tremendous fire had been started, and what might not
follow?... It was enough to shake one’s nerves, for the
individual is so helpless! All one can do at such a time is
to hope and to argue that Paris is large and a bomb small;
that the chances of a bomb falling where one happens to
be are almost infinitesimal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sound came very near indeed. Kendall could not
see what caused this, but it was an anti-aircraft gun
mounted on a truck which had come to a stop at an open
space at the mouth of the Avenue de l’Opéra and was
industriously blazing away at the moon.... Kendall
wished he were dressed and down-stairs with company at
hand; he would even have consented to descend into an
<i>abri</i>, an experience which had not so far been his. He
wondered what an <i>abri</i> looked like. At any rate, there
were plenty of them, for nearly every building in Paris
was defaced by a poster announcing, “<i>Abri, 30 places....
Abri, 60 places.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>The sound, the terrific crashings and retchings and
tearing bursts of tremendous potentiality, gradually
ebbed, then surged up with renewed vigor for a time,
then subsided again, and, after a series of fitful outbursts,
ceased.... But the light which glowed and danced over
the roofs from the distant Faubourg St.-Antoine silhouetting
the tangle of chimney-pots on the Palais Royal
did not subside. The fire burned on....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall returned to bed—and slept.</p>

<p class='c006'>If that raid had made Kendall Ware fearful, what had it
done to the teeming populations of the Faubourg St.-Antoine,
to the closely packed poor who massed about the
Bastille, and to the eastward of this monument to an
event that owed its being to their own ancestors, to those
who used to dwell in St.-Antoine, mother of revolutions!</p>

<p class='c006'>Next noon Bert Stanley and Kendall lunched at a
table on the sidewalk of a little café on the Place de
Ternes and then walked down the Boulevard de Courcelles
a few hundred feet or so to the number that had
been given Bert as a place where a desirable furnished
apartment was to let.</p>

<p class='c006'>They entered through an archway and rang the bell of
the <i>concierge’s</i> apartment. A pleasant, motherly, smiling
old woman came to the door and bowed them in. It was
not difficult to make her understand that they were in
search of an <i>appartement meublé</i>, whereupon she jangled
a huge bunch of keys and invited them to follow her up
four flights of stairs, and ushered them into the rooms
that were for hire.... The apartment of five rooms was
to be had for three hundred francs a month, with twenty
francs extra for the <i>concierge</i>. Yes, a cook could be
obtained, and madame would undertake to have her on
hand when needed. Her wages would be seventy francs
a month. Everything was very easy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where is the bath?” asked Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, monsieur, we have a bath. Of a surety. It is
but three blocks away....”</p>

<p class='c006'>So it was arranged. They were to move in when they
desired, and they left the building feeling quite like
family men and proprietors. They discussed the apartment
from all angles and were exceedingly pleased with
themselves for accomplishing it....</p>

<p class='c006'>“All France needs,” said Bert, quoting some epigrammatic
American friend, “is open plumbing to make it the
greatest country in the world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On the broad stairs of that huge hotel which the
United States Expeditionary Force has taken over for its
headquarters in Paris Bert stopped suddenly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t help you move in to-night,” he said. “But
there isn’t much to do. Get a taxi to take up our boxes
and bedding-rolls. I’m going to be busy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So am I,” said Kendall, Andree recalled to his mind
after she had been absent from it since morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Huh!” grunted Bert. “Same one you were with last
night?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go chase yourself,” said Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it is,” Bert continued, “we might make a mixed
quartet of it. Dinner and then <i>promenade avec</i>. Eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall hesitated. It sounded pleasant, but he was not
sure Andree would like it—and he was not sure about
the sort of girl Bert might have chosen for a companion.
Andree, he had made up his mind, was not the sort of
girl who would take up with anybody.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing doing,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who’s your girl?” Kendall countered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Girl I’ve known quite awhile. Cashier in a shop....
Say, what you getting at, anyhow? Madeleine’s a darn
nice girl, I’m here to tell the world. Looks it, too. I’d
just as soon take her over to the Y. M. C. A. and introduce
her to the head guy—and she’d get past, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know.... I don’t know Andree very well.
She might not like it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rats!” Bert said, scornfully. “They might as well
get acquainted one time as another.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall wasn’t so sure of that. He saw no reason why
the girls should ever get acquainted. In short, he didn’t
follow Bert’s reasoning nor comprehend the point he made.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We can move in to-morrow,” Kendall said, and there
was an end of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a long afternoon for Capt. Kendall Ware, but
at last he found his day’s work at an end and himself in
the street. He went into a café for a hurried meal and
then took the Metro to the Place St.-Michel, arriving
there a good half-hour ahead of the appointed time. He
took a seat at a sidewalk table in a café from which he
could watch the fountain, and ordered a glass of coffee
into which he squirted <i>saccharin</i> from a bottle with a
nozzle like those used by American barbers to put bay
rum on one’s hair. At ten minutes past seven he was
fearful Andree did not mean to keep her appointment.
At a quarter past he was sure of it....  And she was not
due until half past. He was to learn that she was one of
those persons who are never ahead of time, who never
hurry, but who may always be depended upon to arrive
eventually.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was almost exactly seven-thirty when he saw her
coming across the Place. At first he did not recognize
her, for he had been expecting that white suit topped
by its cunning tam-o-’shanter; but she was not in white
this evening. Her dress was of some light summer
material and she wore a dark tam. He never saw her
wear anything but a tam....  She looked more slender,
younger, than before. Why, she seemed to be nothing
but a child! He knew she saw him, but she did not seem
to see him, for she came forward sedately, with those
staid little steps of hers until she was almost at arm’s-length.
Then she looked up and smiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again he found that difficulty in opening the conversation,
in organizing his French for action, and she—she
seemed to have forgotten her English. But each was
glad to see the other. He tried to tell her he was glad
to see her, but made frightful work of his attempt to pronounce
the word <i>joyeux</i>. It necessitated resort to the
dictionary—and immediately awkwardness was dispelled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have worked so—<i>so</i>—hard. All the day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At what?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She held out her book. It was a volume of Racine.
“I have been studying.” She opened it to show him.
“Regard this so long part. It is necessary for me to
learn it. You do not know Racine.... You do not know
this play. Oh, it is very sad, very <i>tragique</i>. But it is
very beautiful....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are you learning all that for?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must.... I must learn many things. It is for the
examination. I must to enter into the <i>Académie</i>. First
I must pass the examination. If I can succeed to enter
into the <i>Académie</i>, then I shall some day go onto the
stage of the Comédie Française and be a great actress
and make much money, and you shall sit and clap your
hands. I shall then come to New York like Madame
Bernhardt, for there is much money, and you shall be
proud I am your friend. <i>N’est-ce pas?</i> But it is very
<i>difficile</i> to enter the <i>Académie</i>. One must know a famous
actor or musician to recommend one.... Do you know
actors and musicians in Paris?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must to meet these actor, then, and know him
well, so you will say to him, ‘Recommend my friend to the
<i>Académie</i>.’ It is very necessary.” She looked up at
him and smiled gaily at her little joke, which was uttered
half in seriousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So you’re an actress, are you?” An actress! It
rather startled him. He had ideas about actresses—American
actresses! But a French actress!...</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non.... Non.... Non....</i> I am nothing. I am
a young girl only, me. But I must do something. I
have to live, is it not? Yes.... Then to be the actress in
the Comédie Française is to be well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was rather relieved. There is a difference between
being an actress and desiring to be one. He had an inspiration.
“Maybe you would like to go to the Comédie
Française to-night,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>She clapped her hands. “But yes—yes. Let us
hurry. It is already late and we shall miss something.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They went to an adjacent bus-stand, where Andree
tore two numbers from a packet fastened to a post. The
bus appeared, passengers alighted, and the conductress
began calling off numbers. Only those were allowed to
mount whose numbers were called, for overcrowding is
not permitted. The bus rolled away without them, but
presently another appeared, their numbers were called,
and in ten minutes they were walking down the Avenue
de l’Opéra toward the theater.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall bought seats, the most expensive in the house,
and they entered, mounting the broad stairway to the
gallery, where they permitted themselves to be shown
into a species of box by an attendant. The play was
just commencing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you onderstan’ it?” Andree asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not enough to do any good.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I shall explain it to you.” And as the action
progressed she pattered on with explanations and observations
very cunningly and charmingly. “You see thees ol’
man? He is in love with thees yo’ng girl. But she—she
does not love him. It is ver’ sad. Thees yo’ng man who
is ver’ handsome, she loves him.” Suddenly she turned
to him and asked: “Are men in America—oh, how do you
say—what is the word? <i>Fidèle.</i> Do you know <i>fidèle</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Faithful—constant—is that it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. Are American men so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why—generally, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She shook her head somberly. “Frenchmen are not.
They are most <i>infidèle</i>. It is ver’ sad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How about French girls?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, some are <i>fidèle</i> and some not. Some Frenchmen
are <i>fidèle</i>. The poor. <i>Oui.</i> It is the rich men and
women who are not <i>fidèle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you rich?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed. “No, I am ver’ <i>fidèle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So the poor folks always marry and are faithful?” he
asked, with real curiosity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, they are faithful. Not always do they marry.
No. Sometimes they are too poor, sometimes they do
not want to, but they are <i>fidèle</i>. But yes. Do young
men and young girls in America always marry?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is very strange. Not so in France. No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A young man love a young girl, and a young girl love
a young man.... They marry, maybe. That is well.
But maybe they do not marry. It is expensive to marry.
Then they see each other very often and he gives her
money so she can live.... That is well, because they are
<i>fidèle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall gasped mentally. What would Detroit, what
would his mother think of such a theory of life as this?
How would they regard a mode of living which places
fidelity over the solemn forms of marriage? Here was a
people who apparently valued love and fidelity more
than marriage licenses and wedding-rings!... It sounded
very naughty to Kendall. Also it made him think. His
mother and his father tried to function in him simultaneously
and made a chaos of his thoughts....</p>

<p class='c006'>The play continued. “Oh, you should onderstan’
French better. You must speak it well, <i>well</i>!” she
exclaimed. “Then I can read poems to you. Do you
know French poetry?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He laughed. “I know one poem,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell it to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He recited:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Je vous aime,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Je vous adore,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Que voulez-vous encore?</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>She turned to look full in his face, her lovely, childish
eyes alight with mischief. “It is not a poem,” she said;
“it is a declaration.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Exactly,” he said, half seriously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh no, no, no! You do not love me.... It ees not
<i>possible</i>. No. You do not know me enough yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Without thought he made the leap. “Of course I do.
How could I help it?... Don’t you love me?” He talked
to her as he would talk to a child.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know—yet. I have not known you. We
shall see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was perfectly serene and perfectly serious. It
startled him. “By Jove!” he said to himself, “things
move rapidly in this country.” He was right. France
has a way of omitting unessentials and of disregarding
shams and subterfuges. If there is a destination to
arrive at, France does not walk around the block to
reach it, but cuts straight across.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are sure you are not married?” she said. “You
tell the truth?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m not, and I’m not going to be,” he said, decidedly.
At least he would put an end to any such speculations.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>” There it was again, that direct, troublesome
<i>why</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I don’t like it. I don’t want to be married.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She nodded. Apparently the reason was perfectly good
and sufficient to her. She directed her attention to the
play.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now,” she said, “thees ol’ man he has make love to
thees yo’ng girl. Also he has promise her much money,
and she will love him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t like that,” he said. “I can see, maybe, why
people should love each other and all that, but the money
part of it! I don’t like that at all. That isn’t—good.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i> It is that a girl must live. She must eat.
Because she loves must she starve?”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was practical France speaking, and France, in
spite of temperament, in spite of surface excitability and
eccentricity, is eminently practical—especially your France
of the poorer sort. France may jump, but she jumps
with her eyes open, and with a pretty sure knowledge of
where she will fall.... The play moved on to its climax,
Andree translating, but little translation was necessary,
for the pantomime carried the story.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will be better for you to see a tragedy,” said Andree.
“This is <i>comédie</i>. The actors speak fast in <i>comédie</i>; in
tragedy they speak more slow.” She showed him how
tragic actors speak, and it was deliciously funny.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then came the climax in which “thees ol’ man” took
“thees yo’ng girl” to the railway station and delivered her
into the hands of her youthful lover. Andree was in tears.
The magnificent acting affected Kendall himself, touched
his emotions. He felt Andree’s hand move spontaneously
to touch his arm as though in sympathy with the bereaved
and forsaken old man, and Kendall took her little fingers
in his palm and patted them very much as he would have
stroked the hand of a weeping child.... She was so
fragile, so childlike, so <i>nice</i>. He regarded her covertly,
wondering what was going on under that curly black hair
... assuring himself that it was impossible for any one
to think of anything but sweetness in connection with her.
Yet she was a mystery. He was incapable of understanding
her, and never came to understand her. A
mystery she always remained to him—but a sweet
mystery, a dainty mystery, a mystery never touched by
unworthy things or thoughts.... And that was another
mystery which he might one day understand dimly.
He might come to a height from which his vision would
be so clear that he could understand that she was good
with that natural goodness which comes from God ... not
with that conventional, rule-of-thumb goodness which is
a product of narrow beliefs and set dogmas. Kendall
was good himself, but he was not capable of attaining to
a goodness such as Andree’s, for he could never approach
her naturalness, the instinct which was in her for following
always a path upon which God could smile, even if men
should frown.... Doubtless the frowns of men weigh
but little in the judgments of God....</p>

<p class='c006'>They left the theater silently, the emotions evoked
by the drama still moving them and drawing them
together. He felt a great tenderness for her and almost
fancied he was in love. It was a fair imitation. Whatever
it was, it was not bad, but good. He would not be
the worse, but the better, for having experienced it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My friend and I have rented an apartment,” he said,
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your friend? What is his name?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert Stanley.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will live together?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will know him then.... You shall show him to
me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you like.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where is thees apartment?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He told her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is it very <i>grand</i>?” She used the word in the French,
not the English signification.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Two bedrooms, dining-room, <i>salon</i>. It is very comfortable.
We shall move in to-morrow—and we’re going
to have a cook.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cook? What is cook?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Again recourse must be had to the dictionary, and
there followed a lesson in pronouncing the rather difficult
word <i>cuisinière</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Has thees friend, this Monsieur Stanley, a friend—like
me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do not know? You have not seen her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is droll.... And thees cook?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I haven’t seen her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must come to see thees apartment and thees cook.
I must know how much you pay, and if it is too much....
Ah, you shall have a dinner and she shall cook, and I
shall be there, and your friend, thees Monsieur Stanley,
and <i>his</i> friend. We shall know each other.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know,” he said, doubtfully, thinking of the
proprieties and wondering what the <i>concierge</i> would say
if he were to give a dinner such as she suggested. His
acquaintance with <i>concierges</i> was limited.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again they were walking up the dark Boulevard St.-Michel,
and again she would not permit him to accompany
her to her door. “Good night.... It was ver’ nice,
and I think you are ver’ nice—perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you don’t love me?” he asked, trifling with
destiny without intention, as young men will trifle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know—yet.... I do not know you. And
you do not love me. Oh no, no! It is not possible.
You make fun of me. I can see you make <i>grimace</i> even
in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When do we play together again?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Soon.... I cannot see you to-morrow, but the day
after—yes.... It is not a good place to meet, the
Place St.-Michel. It is far. No, it shall be the Metro,
Place de la Concorde, at <i>sept heures</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Seven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.... And you will not fail?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was of a mind to kiss her good night as he had kissed
American girls whom he had taken home from parties
and with whom he had played about, but he hesitated.
He didn’t want to spoil things, to make her take fright
and disappear. She was becoming too much a delightful
element in his life for him to take a chance of losing her
now.... And while he hesitated she was gone.</p>

<p class='c006'>As mysteriously as she appeared out of the mazes of the
enormous city she disappeared into them again, and Bert
was apprehensive lest she fail to reappear. He need not
have been apprehensive. There is in life a thread of fate,
of destiny, which attaches one person to another, so that,
even though they separate to the ends of the earth,
they will be drawn together again at some spot in some
hour.... Destiny had woven a strand between Andree
and Kendall....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall Ware and Bert Stanley went early to
<i>petit déjeuner</i> in the dining-room of the Union, for
they had decided to move before the day’s work began.
The waitress laid her order-slips on the table, and as she
did so Kendall noticed that her eyes were red and swollen
with weeping and that it was with difficulty that she
restrained her sobs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle is sad this morning,” he said, sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Oui, monsieur</i>, very sad.... Oh, it is my brother!
The word came in the night. The <i>boches</i> have killed
him....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor kid!” said Kendall. It was his first direct contact
with the sadness of war, and it affected him strongly.
Evidences of this sort had been all about him, but this was
so close!</p>

<p class='c006'>“He was the last,” she said, finding comfort in his
sympathy. “There were three brothers ...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s rotten,” Kendall said when she moved away.
“Rotten. These poor women!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert made no reply. He was not the sort to voice
sympathy if he felt it, nor was he the sort to be moved
as Kendall was moved. He was more objective, less
emotional—a trifle boisterous and swanking and not given
to peering below the surface of events. It was his motto
to take what came and make the best of it. On the
whole, he was a careless, buoyant, thoughtless young
American whose two great objects in life were to get on
in the world and to have a good time. He had none of
the scruples and inhibitions that made Kendall Ware more
complex—not that he was unscrupulous; not that he was
not an ordinarily square, able, decent sort of boy, but
there did not reside in him that meticulous ethical sense
that Kendall had inherited from his mother, and which
had been softened and made finer by inheritances from
his father.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Four sons out of one family,” said Kendall, “and
there are thousands of such cases, I suppose.” He
stopped. “And every man killed is not a loss to his
mother and sisters alone—but to the girl he was going
to marry or had just married. After this war, Bert,
where in thunder are the girls of France going to find
enough husbands to go around?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They aren’t,” Bert said, and then he grinned. “That’s
why the American Army is so popular with them. Every
one of us is a possible husband, so look out, young fellow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A million—maybe two million—girls with nobody to
marry.... It’s hell!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s up to us to do our best to keep them from worrying
about it,” said Bert, characteristically. “Come on,
we’ve got to hustle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They loaded down a taxicab with their trunks and rolls
and were driven to their new home. The <i>concierge</i>,
naïvely proud of having two American officers as her
tenants, bustled about them in genuine, motherly welcome.
Kendall liked the brightness of her smile, it was
so brisk, so alert; he liked her looks as a whole....
Why, she might have been his aunt, he thought. She
had the look of an aunt, the sort a nephew would delight
to visit.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have your <i>cuisinière</i>,” she said. “I recommend her.
She will please messieurs.... But she is large, <i>une bonne
femme</i>. She comes to-morrow and she is called Arlette.
All things may be left to her, do you understand? Yes,
yes, Arlette will see to all, to the marketing and the
accounts—if <i>messieurs les officiers</i> desire. Shall you dine at
home to-morrow evening?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert looked at Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I had an engagement with Madeleine. Don’t see
why we shouldn’t dine here, though.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why,” Kendall said, hesitatingly, “Andree said she
wanted to meet you and Madeleine—and to see the
apartment. We might—” He was still reluctant.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Bert settled the thing for him out of hand. “Dinner
for four, if you please. At seventy-thirty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A nice dinner,” Kendall added, rather apprehensively.
“There will be ladies.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He watched the <i>concierge’s</i> face to see how this news
would affect her. Apparently it did not affect her at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of a surety,” she said, “Arlette shall be notified.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The young men disposed of their traps temporarily
and walked to their offices.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I heard of a bully place to eat,” said Bert. He was
always finding new and excellent and quaint cafés. “Up
on the rue de Richelieu. Marty’s they call it. A French
officer told me about it—says it’s mostly patronized by
actors from the Comédie and artists and newspaper men.
Suppose we take a look.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Suits me,” said Kendall. “Meet you in the Union at
seven.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was more anxious to see Marty’s than he
would have admitted to Bert; as soon as Bert mentioned
the fact that its <i>habitués</i> were actors he wanted to go to
the place very badly. He wanted to see what French
actors were like—and actresses. In his whole life he had
never seen an actor off the stage, had never been especially
curious about them, but now it was different. Andree
was going to be an actress if she could, and he wanted to
see for himself what sort of creature she would be when
she came to be one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since he left Andree the night before he had been filled
with uneasiness. Again and again he reviewed his conversation
with her and found it disturbing. He had
rather lost his head, he perceived. He had told her he
loved her when, so he declared to himself, he did not love
her in the least, and the fact that she had made light of
his declaration and had refused to believe in the possibility
of a so-sudden affection helped the situation very little.
What troubled him most was that he had made a start of
some kind, to travel some sort of path. He didn’t know
what sort of path it was nor whither it led, but he was
vaguely apprehensive of it. He fancied that half-meant
declaration of his had altered the status of himself and
Andree altogether, and placed them on a different basis.
But he was wrong.... He remembered that he wanted to
kiss her, but was not inclined to take himself to task for
that. What could be more natural than to want to kiss
Andree? He never saw anybody who was more kissable....
Again and again he consoled himself by conjuring
up her face and studying it, and by remembering her
modesty, her reserve, her sweetness and goodness. Of
course it was all right. There wasn’t the slightest danger
with a girl like Andree—if, of course, they didn’t actually
fall in love with each other. He didn’t want to do that.
Andree was a <i>foreigner</i>. She was not American, but of
another race, speaking another language. This may
sound droll, but how many Americans are there who
would have felt exactly as Kendall felt!</p>

<p class='c006'>Therefore the idea of marriage did not occur to him as
of the possibilities. He could not imagine himself marrying
a foreigner. Here his mother functioned without
hindrance. She had been against all foreigners. To her
a foreigner had been a sort of freak of nature, a distressing
accident. Anybody who was not English had
been guilty of some sort of obscure offense against nature.
Of course there were degrees of foreignness—some, as the
Chinese, were more guilty than others—but it was a
difference in degree and that was all. This was a basic
<i>fact</i> to her, a part of her, and, without consciously instructing
Kendall, she had impressed her way of thinking
upon him until it was his own. He did not think of marriage
with Andree any more than he would have thought
of eating a rose....</p>

<p class='c006'>As a matter of fact, he didn’t know just what he did
think of in connection with her. He had no definite
hopes. She had occurred in his life and now he was
drifting along, letting matters take care of themselves.
He simply was without intentions of any sort.... But
he was vaguely uneasy.</p>

<p class='c006'>At seven-thirty Kendall and Bert entered Marty’s a
bit diffidently, as young men do who go to a place where
they are uncertain of just how to behave. It was a dingy
little café, poorly lighted and rather crowded with things.
One passed a sort of bar upon which were piled <i>langoustes</i>
and melons, and behind which was madame, very fat
and capable, surrounded by bottles of various kinds, and
keeping an efficient eye on her patrons and upon the
finances of the institution. A half-partition of glass
separated the bar from the rest of the room, which was
filled with tables in parallel rows, with a narrow aisle
down the middle. When filled to capacity the café might
contain as many as thirty persons.</p>

<p class='c006'>Madame bade them welcome with a smile and a <i>bon soir</i>,
and motioned them to proceed to a table. They seated
themselves and looked about. Only a few persons were
present, but before a stout waitress dressed in black had
taken their order a considerable party entered and took
seats directly opposite. There were four men and two
women. Almost simultaneously a fifth young man entered
noisily. He waved his cane in the air as he hobbled
in, for he had an artificial leg, and shouted greetings to
everybody. He was rather tall and very thin and pale,
but exceedingly jaunty. His felt hat, a disreputable
affair, was askew on his head, and there was something
rakish about even his limp. With many gestures and
apparent great excitement he rushed from one table to
the other, shaking hands with everybody, and once in a
while stooping to kiss a girl on the cheek. Everybody
laughed with him and at him. At last his eyes perceived
Kendall and Bert and he came lunging across
to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ha!” he shouted, throatily. “Americans! Welcome!
I shall sit at your table and we shall be acquainted, is it
not? You see I spik Engleesh ver’ fine. Behol’! I shall
sit here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have nothing to do with him,” a handsome young
man called to Kendall in French. “He thinks you have
sugar.” And everybody laughed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young man leaped to his feet, waved his arms above
his head, and glared at his accuser. “<i>Bah!</i>” he shouted,
explosively. “You are nothing ...” and sat down very
suddenly, apparently forgetting the whole incident, for
he leaned over the table to Kendall and said: “It is an
argument—yes. You shall decide, is it not? A foolish
argument. Behol’—if there is a king in Siam—eh, you
observe?—and he is rich, oh, ver’, ver’ rich. You
onderstand? Yes? Also, if there is a—what you call—a
electric button here”—he turned wildly and shoved his
thumb against the partition as if he were ringing an
electric bell—“if I could press this button—do you understand?—and
thees king in Siam is dead—oh, queek,
sudden, like thees”—he caught a long thumb-nail against
his upper teeth and snapped it—“so.... Now, then,
if I can so to push the button and thees king is dead, and
all his money is mine—the argument, messieurs, is—shall
I do it. <i>Voilà!...</i>” He leaned back and regarded
them gravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Give it a push,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, you theenk!...” He leaped again to his feet
and extended his hand across the table to Bert, who took
it and shook hands rather embarrassedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am Jacques,” said the young man. “We must to
know one another. You are named—ah, Monsieur Bert....
Monsieur Ken-dall. Ha!... All my friends there,
regard. Messieurs Bert and Ken-dall—my frien’s....
My frien’s—Messieurs Bert and Ken-dall. Now we are
acquaint’, is it not? So.... You see that yo’ng man
who spill soup on his coat. He is Monsieur Robert, great
comedian at the Comédie Française. <i>Oui</i>, he make the
first prize at the <i>Académie</i> one year ago.... That other,
with the hair <i>so</i>.... He is <i>espagnol</i>.... <i>Oui</i>. Also
an actor, but not a comedian. He does <i>so</i>.” Jacques
illustrated by scowling horribly in imitation of the tragic
method. “He also make the first prize at the <i>Académie</i>
before two year.... They are ver’ clever.” Both young
men so described got to their feet and came across to shake
hands. “Those others,” continued Jacques, in full
voice, “are jus’ boys an’ girl. You onderstand? Not
anybody.... That one who look so jealous at hees girl—he
make the dress for ladies. <i>Oui.</i> He have much
money, but no brains.” At this <i>mot</i> everybody shouted
with laughter, and the girl who accompanied the maker
of dresses disentangled herself from him and came across
to sit down by Kendall, putting her cheek up to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She wants you should kees,” said Jacques, and
Kendall shamefacedly planted a hurried kiss on her
cheek. “And now you shall see—thees yo’ng man with
her, he is ver’ jealous. Perhaps he shall beat her w’en
they arrive at home.... <i>Oui....</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall proffered a cigarette to Jacques, and then
extended his case toward the young actors across the
aisle. They were real American cigarettes, one of which
will do more to carry you into the good graces of a <i>poilu</i>
than many bottles of <i>vin ordinaire</i>. Both young men
came across, not too eagerly, and helped themselves.
Monsieur Robert, the younger, and a very handsome,
boyish, pleasing young man, seated himself in the chair
the dressmaker’s companion had just vacated. He understood
a word of English, but dared not venture an
attempt to speak it; however, he was exceedingly cordial
in French. Kendall managed to understand most that he
said. It was a very laughable, but somewhat <i>risqué</i>,
account of a conversation he had essayed with an Englishwoman
during a recent engagement in London, carried
on through the agency of a dictionary. Purely through
accident the young man’s finger had pointed to a certain
word when it should have been directed to quite another—with
the result that he received a sound box on the
ear. He told the thing with such boyish delight, and
with such naïve joy in the outraged prudery of the Englishwoman,
that Kendall laughed as he had laughed at
nothing for months. This pleased the young actor.
If Kendall had been diplomatically angling for Monsieur
Robert’s friendship, he could not have contrived better.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly he remembered Andree. “You must know
a famous actor,” she had commanded him. Andree
desired the good offices of an actor in her effort to enter the
<i>Académie</i>—and this young gentleman had carried off the
first prize in that national institution but a year before....
He regarded Monsieur Robert with new interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>While Kendall and Monsieur Robert made merry, if
difficult, conversational progress, Bert was instructing
Jacques in colloquial American in a manner to which
his rather grotesque sense of humor was peculiarly
adapted. “If you meet a lady,” he was saying, “and she
bids you good afternoon, the thing to say, if you want to
be really polite, is, ‘Go jump in the lake.’ Of course you
don’t say this to a lady the first time you meet her,
because it is rather friendly, but possibly the second time.
Do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But surely.... Go jump in the lake.... Ah, it has a
sound, has it not? I like that.” He stood up, placed
his hand on his heart and bowed to Bert profoundly.
“Ah, madame,” he said, in honeyed tones, “you should
go to jump in the lake.... Is it so you say it? It is a
phrase. I shall remember it. And what does one say
if—”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall lost the next lesson, for Monsieur Robert
arose and shook hands warmly. “I hope you shall dine
here often,” he said. “Me, I always dine here.... So
we shall become better acquainted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Others of the company took their departure to their
theaters or with their actor companions, or to write
their criticisms, and as they went out, laughing and
jostling, each stopped at the table of the Americans to
shake hands and to say good evening. It was all very
genial and companionable—a sort of family affair—but
very un-American and droll.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall and Bert took their departure soon afterward.
The evening was rather hot, but they determined to walk
home, a distance of a couple of miles. As they were passing
the Hôtel Wagram, Kendall glanced inside and saw,
standing just within the lobby, the Miss Knox who had
been his playmate on the voyage across the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait a minute. Here’s a girl I know,” he said to
Bert, and led his companion inside.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Captain Ware!” she exclaimed. “I was wondering
if I should ever see you again. What have you
been doing? Have you been to the front?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. I’m anchored in Paris. And you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve been down at Tours, but now I’ve been ordered
to report at headquarters here. I don’t know where I
shall be sent.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better get assigned to Paris,” he said, rashly, “then
we can play around together.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know.... I’d rather be nearer things. It’s
more interesting.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anyhow, you’ll be here a day or two. Can’t you
take dinner with me to-morrow”——he stopped, hesitated,
got a bit red, and finished, lamely—“soon?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It looks as if I might have competition as a playmate,”
she said, dryly. “Is she nice? Who is she? Red
Cross or Y. M. C. A.?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Neither.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed. “And your French is so miserable,” she
said. “How do you talk to her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She speaks some English,” said Kendall, falling into
a trap which had not been set for him, and Bert and
Maude Knox laughed as he reddened with embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is she pretty?” Miss Knox demanded of Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t think so,” Bert said, solemnly. “He keeps
her under cover. She must be homely or he’d let her be
seen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now I won’t buy you a dinner,” Kendall said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When I am so hungry!” she said, dolefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t blame Ken,” Bert said. “She hardly lets him
have an evening to himself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” said Miss Knox, “if you do get a night off
I’ll be glad to see you. Probably I won’t be here but a
couple of days, though. You come, too, Captain Stanley,
if you like.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And pay for half of the dinner,” said Bert. “That’s
fair. Half the young lady, half the dinner-check. Simple
justice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now I’ve got to run up to my room. I think—mind,
I only think—I’m going to have a bath. If the bathtub
is still there, and if the water hasn’t stopped running,
and if a few other things haven’t happened to the plumbing—Good
night.... Don’t think of coming, Captain
Ware, if it will make any trouble with your friend.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The two young officers walked on up the street. Kendall
did not feel like talking. He was thinking about Andree
and comparing her with Maude Knox. He was wondering
what Andree would think of Maude, and what Maude
would think of Andree. Also he wondered a bit what
Maude thought about <i>him</i> and what sort of an affair she
believed him to be carrying on with Andree.... Not
that it mattered to him in the least what she thought,
but—</p>

<p class='c006'>At last they stood before the building in which their
apartment was located. Bert pulled the bell and presently
the lock clicked. They pushed open the huge door and
stepped into the blackness of the court, lighting matches
to find the light-button. It was a climb of four flights
of stairs to their rooms, which they entered with some
pride of possession and sat down to have a final smoke
before going to bed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder what the <i>concierge</i> will say to our bringing
the girls here for dinner to-morrow night?” Kendall said,
for the point still worried him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Young man,” said Bert, drowsily, “you aren’t in
Detroit. Go to the window and reassure yourself. This
is Paris....”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall was awakened next morning by the sound
of some one shuffling about his room. It was a
woman, and she was moving toward the door with his
shoes in her hand, and for an instant he wondered if
he were in the presence of some new sort of burglar. The
woman was short and very fat, with a large head scantily
covered by that colored hair which does not turn white
at sixty. Her face was broad, her nose was broad and
had a peculiar and laughable up-tilt, her mouth was
broad, and her eyes were very large and kindly. She
had one generous double chin and a quite respectable
growth of whiskers. Her eyes and her nose were the most
notable features. One liked her eyes and one could not help
laughing at her nose. As a complete figure she was droll.</p>

<p class='c006'>She saw that he was awake and grinned timidly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Bon jour, monsieur</i>,” she said, and then, waggling his
shoes, followed her greeting by a torrent of French in
which the word “<i>chaussers</i>” occurred frequently. She
spoke very rapidly and was unintelligible to Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arlette?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Oui, je suis Arlette</i>,” she said, with a broad grin of
delight, and then scudded through the door suddenly, as
if she had been overtaken by a fit of embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall got out of bed and called Bert, who was still
asleep.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hey, somebody’s swiped my shoes!” came presently
in a voice of complaint.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shut up!” said Kendall, going into his friend’s room.
“It’s Arlette. I saw her sneaking out with mine when
I woke up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arlette? ... Oh, <i>she’s</i> here, eh? What’s she want
with my shoes? I’ve heard these French cooks could—”</p>

<p class='c006'>But just then Arlette pushed the door open, regardless
of the state of her young employers’ toilets, and deposited
the shoes on the floor, carefully cleaned and
polished.</p>

<p class='c006'>The boys looked at each other, weighing this event in
the light of their experience with American domestics.
It was so surprising as to be upsetting.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Seventy francs a month—including shines,” said
Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And seventy francs is fourteen dollars.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And my mother pays her cook twelve a week—and
hires another girl to wait on the cook! ... Come to
France to solve the domestic-servant problem! ... I
wonder if she bathes us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They hurried into their clothes and went to the dining-room,
where a great pitcher of chocolate stood in the center
of the table, flanked by a pot of jam and a basket of
rolls. On each plate was a bowl—not a cup. Arlette
entered and stood with her stomach against the table’s
edge, whence she looked first at the food and then
at her employers. She pointed accusingly at the confiture
and said, “<i>Abricot!</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Apricot, eh? <i>Très-bien.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mais non, messieurs.... Mais non.</i> It is not well....
Oh, the price—it is terrific, it is wicked. Of a
surety, you are robbed. We shall have no more. <i>Messieurs
les officiers</i> shall not so be robbed. I shall see well
to it. But I was directed to procure confiture!” She
crossed her pudgy hands on her ample stomach and
rolled her eyes to heaven, calling upon Divinity to witness
that apricot jam at four francs a jar was a thing to excite
horror in any well-regulated and economical mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall strove to comfort her, but it was impossible.
No quantity of assurances that it was <i>très-bien</i> could
remove her mind from the enormity of the cost of that
delicacy, and she went out shaking her head and muttering
and sniffling a trifle. In a moment she re-entered to ask
what was desired for dinner. It was the first and the
last time she made such an inquiry. In the future she
made suggestions herself, but never did she ask outright
what these strange young savages would have to eat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Poulet</i>,” said Bert. “Chicken.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette rested her hands on her hips and stared at him
aghast. She repeated the word after him as if unwilling
to believe such a thing had been mentioned in her presence.
“<i>Poulet? ... Poulet? ... Non, non, non.</i> But no. It
is too dear. The cost, consider the cost! Veal, perhaps,
but never pullet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Young ladies are coming and we wish a suitable
dinner,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But pullet—oh no. There shall be a suitable dinner,
but there shall not be pullet. It is a thing unthinkable—at
the price. Before the war—yes, but now! <i>Mon Dieu!</i>
do the American officers consider what price is demanded
for pullet?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The American officers did not, nor did Arlette enlighten
them, but she continued stubbornly to refuse to
procure it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken shrugged his shoulders. “It looks as if we were
going to be henpecked,” he said, ruefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert laughed. “Anyhow we get no chicken. I wonder
if we can have a salad?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Yes, a salad was thinkable, and even string-beans or
cauliflower or peas—but pullet! Arlette’s mind refused
to be diverted from pullet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very well, then,” Bert said. “Whatever you want,
Arlette. You’re the boss. But get enough for four.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette turned around and made for the door again, but
paused on the threshold to turn and stare at them
unbelievingly and to utter in a voice of anguish the word,
“<i>Poulet</i>.” She said it as one might say bubonic plague.</p>

<p class='c006'>As Kendall left the dining-room and went for his cap
he saw a tiny, big-eyed face suddenly whisk out of sight
around the corner of the hall which led to the kitchen.
It had been the merest glimpse, such as a believing mortal
might hope some day to catch of a fairy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hey, there!” he called in English, for he had a way
with children and children had a way with him. There
was no response, so he gave chase. The fairy had scudded
into the kitchen, and was standing close to Arlette,
concealing herself in the old woman’s ample skirts.
Arlette gazed at him with some apprehension as he came
into the little kitchen, wondering, doubtless, what these
barbarians would do to her for bringing a child into their
lair, but a sight of his face reassured her, and she smiled
a bit dubiously and placed her pudgy hand on the little
girl’s head.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall got down on one knee and held out his hand
gravely. “<i>Bon jour, mademoiselle</i>,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Bon jour, monsieur</i>,” she said, with the cunningest
little lisp, her face very sober and a little frightened,
and she shook hands with him primly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How is your husband and all the family?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her eyes opened wide—blue and sweet they were—and
she looked up at Arlette before replying. “But,
monsieur, I have not yet a husband.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.... That is bad. You must find a husband.
What, at your age? Oh <i>là, là, là, là!</i> And what is
mademoiselle’s age?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eight years, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He shook his head. “And no husband.... Would
you like an American husband, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh yes, monsieur. The Americans they are very
nice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was the tiniest of mites with such a creamy-pink
complexion as Ken had never seen. Her face was oval
and beautiful, with a fairy-like childish beauty that
deserved to be immortalized by some master of the
brush and canvas. He looked from her to Arlette and
was unwilling to admit a relationship between them or
the possibility that this sprite could ever grow with the
weight of years and labor to resemble the old woman.
He wanted to kiss her; he wanted to kiss her on those
little lips, parted a trifle now in her interest, but usually
resting so lightly the one upon the other with the merest
pursing which seemed to say they were made for kisses.
He drew her to him, and she came diffidently, but not
bashfully, and he lifted her to his knee. She seemed
almost to be without weight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How do you name yourself?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arlette,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My granddaughter,” Arlette explained. “Her father
is a prisoner of war in Germany—in consequence of
which her mother is dead....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pauvre Mignonne</i>,” he said, and drew her close to
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked up into his face briefly, and then, for the
first time, she smiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will come often to see me,” he said. “We must
be friends—and then, who knows, but I may have to take
you to America with me. You have no husband; I
have no wife. I shall, perhaps, ask your grandmother
for your hand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur, I shall come often if monsieur permits....
And I shall sing for monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall like that. And now let me see your hand.
Something is the matter with it.” He examined her
palm gravely, then placed a franc upon it and closed her
fingers tightly. “There, that will cure it, I think....
And you will not forget me—and you will think about
going back to America with me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur,” she said, very gravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall rejoined Bert and they walked together to the
Étoile and down the Champs Élysées to the hotel which
sheltered the huge office staff of the American Expeditionary
Force in Paris.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope everything goes off right to-night,” said
Kendall, who was still a trifle dubious despite Andree’s
expressed desire to meet Bert and his friend.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sure. We’ll make it a regular party,” Bert said,
confidently. “What’s worrying you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You never can tell how strange girls will get on
together.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fiddlesticks!... Madeleine will get on with anybody.
See you at the house at seven.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Promptly at seven Kendall was awaiting Andree at the
entrance to the Metro in the Place de la Concorde, and
promptly at the hour she appeared, walking leisurely, as
she always seemed to do, and with an air of not seeing
him at all until she was very close to him, an air which
he came to associate with their meetings. There was
something diffident about it, something modest and
maidenly that he liked.... Then she would pause,
always hesitatingly, as if she rather doubted her welcome,
and look up into his face without the vestige of a smile,
expecting him to extend his hand, and then she would
shake hands very gravely. It was always so.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have made much work to-day?... You are
<i>fatigué</i>?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, no.... And you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have been—what do you say?—<i>ennuyée</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bored.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yes, bored.... Have you thought of me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He had intended to be most circumspect, to make no
repetitions of his half-joking declaration of their last
meeting, but with her delightful presence beside him,
with that half-veiled, appealing glance from her darkly
shadowed eyes, good resolutions were forgotten.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve thought of nothing else,” he said, and was near
to the truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But no”—she shook her head childishly—“you have
not thought of me at all. It is not possible.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought of you when I got up, I thought of you all
the morning, I thought of you at noon and all the afternoon—and
I am thinking of you now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed quietly. The drollery of his protestation
pleased her and made her gay. Thereafter it became a
formula, a sort of ritual. She would ask him if he had
thought of her, and he would recite, “When I got up, all
the morning, at noon, all the afternoon,” and always she
would laugh as if it were very new and very funny and
very delightful.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where do we go?” she said, as he took his place by her
side.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To dine with Arlette.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“With Arlette!... Who is thees Arlette?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My cook,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At your apartment?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert and Madeleine are coming, too. You said you
wanted to know them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.... Yes.... I will know them. And this
yo’ng girl, this Madeleine, does your friend love
her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He spread his hands and shrugged his shoulders. “How
should I know?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He has not told you?... He is your friend and he
has not told you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you told him about me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A little; not much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle Pourquoi!... Oh, because you were
none of his business.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I do not onderstan’, I do not onderstan’.” She
clasped hands together with mock despair, and with the
cunningest expression of bafflement on her face. “I do
not onderstan’.... It ees ver’ difficult, ver’ difficult.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shall we take the Metro or a taxi?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Metro, of a certainty. It arrives, does it not?
And the taxi—oh, it is very dear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re a great little economist,” he said, laughingly,
but nevertheless wonderingly. American girls had never
been so careful to choose the less expensive of two methods.</p>

<p class='c006'>As they were descending into the Metro they came
suddenly face to face with Maude Knox, and Kendall
felt himself blushing hotly, and was ashamed of himself
for it, so he blushed even more hotly than before. He
stopped determinedly, and held Andree’s arm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Knox,” he said, “I want you to meet Mademoiselle—”
He hesitated, for he did not know Andree’s
family name. This piece of ignorance had never presented
itself to him before. She had been Andree to him,
and nothing more. She had needed no other name. “I
want you to meet Mademoiselle Andree,” he finished,
rather defiantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The girls looked at each other, Miss Knox with a
humorous twinkle in her eye, but nevertheless with a
glint of keen appraisal; Andree rather timidly, as if she
would like to hide behind Kendall as little Arlette had
hidden behind her grandmother’s skirts that morning, and
peer out big-eyed at this woman of another race.</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude Knox extended her hand. “Delighted,” she
said, and smiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle is very agreeable,” said Andree, but she
did not smile; instead she studied Miss Knox’s face intently
and very gravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s our train,” said Kendall, at a loss how otherwise
to proceed with the conversation, and he snatched
Andree away before another word could be exchanged.
Maude Knox stood looking after them with a smile that
had in it a hint of something that was not humor, that
mingled curiosity with pique.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree and Kendall alighted from the Metro at the
Étoile and walked to the apartment. He was rather
taken aback to see the <i>concierge</i> sweeping the walk in
front of the entrance, for he had hoped subconsciously
to smuggle Andree in without being seen. He could
hardly have explained this had he been asked. But he
need not have been apprehensive. The <i>concierge</i> stopped,
peered at Andree keenly for a second, then smiled and
bade them good day. Kendall did not know it, but
Andree had been inspected and had passed the inspection
handsomely. Andree, however, was well aware of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert and Madeleine had not arrived, and Kendall
showed Andree into their <i>salon</i> with something of a
flourish. She stood looking about her at the massive gilt
furniture, at the large bronze statue of Diana with a bent
arrow in her hand which stood on a pedestal in a corner,
and at a bronze monstrosity depicting Ceres which, half
life size, overweighted the mantel. Her little nose was
curling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh,” she said in disappointment, “thees is not good.
No, no. It is ver’ bad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is sort of fussy,” said Kendall, more than half
afraid that she would take fright at so much wretched
taste on exhibition and refuse to remain. She seemed of
a mind to beat a retreat. “But don’t blame me for it,”
he hastened to say. “It isn’t my furniture, you know.
This is a furnished apartment—<i>meublé</i>, you know. I
don’t like these gimcracks any better than you do, but
I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She continued to shake her head dolefully; then her
eyes spied a sort of throne between the windows, a fearful
example of what a piece of furniture can be, and clapped
her hands with childish delight. “Oh, it ees for me.
See!” She ran to it and seated herself on the threadbare
seat, her tiny feet dangling above the floor. “Behold!... Regard
me!... I am a queen, is it not? You
have not the manners. It is that you should kneel.
Here ... at once.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Laughingly he humored her whim and, dropping on
one knee, he lifted her hand to his lips. She laughed delightedly.
Then she stepped down. “Come. I shall
see the rest. You shall show me.” And she insisted upon
being shown over the apartment, making little sounds of
approval or disapproval as she went, and finally they
reached the kitchen where Arlette was busy over the
stove.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Bon soir, madame</i>,” said Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Bon soir, mademoiselle</i>,” Arlette replied, and swiftly
scrutinized this young woman whom her master was
bringing into his home. It was a frank appraisal, for
Arlette felt a sort of responsibility for these strange,
rather boisterous, difficult-to-understand, but kindly
young savages of whom she had taken charge. Then she
smiled and released a flood of French upon Andree, who
smiled and chattered back at her. Kendall caught only
a word here and there, so rapidly did they speak, but it
was evident to him that they approved of each other, and
there was something very pleasing to him in that. He
felt that Arlette would not have approved of everybody.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently they returned to the <i>salon</i> and Andree said,
seriously: “She is well. I am satisfied. She is of a
trustworthiness. Yes....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know what I’d do if she hadn’t suited you,”
said Kendall, with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I do not onderstan’.... I do not onderstan’.
And why does your left eye laugh when your right
does not? It ees ver’ fonny.” She pointed. “Oh, see!
It is laugh! It is laugh!”</p>

<p class='c006'>He wrinkled his nose at her, so bold and familiar had
he become, and she pretended anger.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You make <i>grimace</i> at me. It is not good. Why do
you make <i>grimace?</i>” Then her mood changed. “Thees
American girl—she is your friend?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“An acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You love <i>her</i>. I know it.... You love her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see her often—and you love her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I didn’t know she was in Paris until last night, and
I certainly don’t love her.” She had withdrawn into
herself and become a stranger to him. It startled him,
frightened him, not so much because she had withdrawn
herself from him, for he guessed that it was mostly
pretense, but because he had a glimpse of what it would
mean to him if she should withdraw herself utterly.
“I don’t love anybody but you,” he said, and he said it
without wishing or intending to say it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” she said, decidedly. “It ees not possible.
You mock me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before he could enter upon protestations Bert opened
the outer door and handed a young woman into the apartment.
Kendall could see that she was tall and rather
slight, but that was all. He was anxious for her to
appear, first out of curiosity, but principally to be reassured
as to Andree’s reception of the stranger.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a moment Bert appeared in the door with the girl
at his side, both laughing as at some joke which had
just been uttered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hello, children!” Bert said, a trifle noisily. “Mademoiselle
Andree, is it not?” He advanced and took the
hand which she held out to him primly while she studied
his face with a calm, inscrutable expression. “Mademoiselle
Andree, Monsieur Ken, this is Mademoiselle
Madeleine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Both shook hands with the laughing girl, Andree still
with that restraint which was always hers at a first meeting,
Kendall with relief, for he liked Madeleine’s looks.
She was taller than Andree by inches, and not at all
beautiful as Andree was beautiful. The key-note of her
character at first glance seemed to be joyousness, a lightness
of heart, good nature. Her mouth was rather broad,
but not displeasingly so, for it was always showing her
white teeth through a smile that seemed to be the commencement
of a laugh. She was always laughing,
always moving her body or her hands as if the young
life that was in her could not be still.... And yet there
was a shrewd look about her eyes which advertised that
here was no empty head, but a capable young person indeed.... She
was a distinct blonde, with hair which
seemed always just on the point of being disordered,
yet which never seemed to lose control of itself and
become disordered. Later Kendall wondered if Madeleine
and her hair were not very much alike in character.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right, eh?” said Bert, proudly, patting Madeleine’s
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'>She threw him a laughing, affectionate glance, and in
another instant she and Andree were chattering to each
other with a rapidity which was not only astonishing,
but utterly unintelligible to the boys. If Andree spoke
with bewildering rapidity, what could one say of Madeleine?
Kendall laughed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle Mitrailleuse,” he said, and it was a name
that clung, for it was so apt. She was a veritable machine-gun,
shooting out words with a rapidity almost incredible.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette appeared in the door of the dining-room and
announced that dinner was served. The quartet of
young people took their places at table, and Kendall began
serving a wonderful pea soup from a big bowl while Arlette
stood in the door with hands folded across her stomach,
watching anxiously and shooting quick glances at
Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is soup,” she said, suddenly, and then darted out of
sight with startling abruptness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The soup was followed by meat, which Arlette placed
on the table with something like a flourish, then stepped
back and addressed Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Veal,” she said. “Oh, mademoiselle, the meats are
too dear. It is not my fault.... Perhaps this will be
tough. Who knows?” She paused anxiously to look
first at Bert and then at Ken, who was carving.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s all right, Arlette,” he assured her, but she was not
satisfied, remaining as close to the table as she could
press and watching with an expression of the most comical
anxiety while Ken cut off a morsel and put it in his
mouth. She then, apparently, calculated the difficulty
he encountered in mastication, her jaws working a trifle
as if to aid in the process, and presently uttered a deep
sigh of relief. According to her judgment, Ken had not
chewed too laboriously and the meat was satisfactory.
Only then did she retreat to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is very droll,” said Madeleine, restraining her
laughter with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is very <i>well</i>,” said Andree, nodding her head
prettily, “but also she is droll.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Monsieur Bert also is droll,” said Madeleine, reaching
out to bestow a little pat upon Bert’s hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All Americans are droll,” said Andree, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Tous les Américains sont fous</i>,” said Ken, quoting a
saying of Paris, which adored Americans at the moment
and delighted in their peculiarities and their absurdities,
and laughed at them as one laughs at the antics of children,
deciding, as its dictum had it, that all the Americans
were mad.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>viande</i> was served alone, as is the French custom,
without a vegetable, but with a delicious sauce which the
girls, disdaining butter, sopped from their plates with
their bread—not at all a manifestation of ill-breeding,
but the proper and natural and habitual method of eating.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken turned to Andree. “I met your actor for you last
night,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have known an actor?... What actor?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Monsieur Robert, of the Comédie Française. Do you
know him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have seen him. He is a very good actor—and very
handsome, <i>n’est-ce pas</i>? Have you spoke of me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, my dear. Give a fellow time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you must, you must.... It is ver’ <i>nécessaire</i>—oh,
you do not know how ver’ <i>nécessaire</i>. It is my need to
enter into the <i>Académie</i>, and he must help me. You will
know him better.” It was a command. “You will then
make me to know him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should say <i>not</i>.... He’s too handsome. I’m not
going to take any such chance as that—I should say <i>not</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I should be jealous,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non, non, non!</i>... You do not care. You only
<i>say</i>....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How am I going to convince you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know. It is not possible.... I will not
believe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken turned despairingly to Madeleine. “She refuses
to believe that I love her. How shall I make her believe?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Madeleine laughed at him. “How should I know?...
It is for you to do. It is a thing easy of accomplishment.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is it easy to make her love me, too?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“French girls are not cold,” she said, in the most matter-of-fact
way imaginable.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He loves an American girl.... I have seen her this
night—yes. She is not beautiful. American girls do not
know how to dress.” Andree shook her head and frowned
at Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette appeared presently with the vegetable, which
she named and waited to see approved, and afterward
with the salad and a like procedure. When the fruit
appeared she made no observation, but asked, calmly,
as if it were the most natural question in the world,
“<i>Petit déjeuner</i> for four?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Breakfast for four! It was dropping a thunderbolt
on Kendall’s plate. He was shocked. He was frightened,
and shot a quick glance at Andree and Madeleine. Andree
was sipping her wine and appeared not to have heard;
if she had heard she was not disturbed nor shocked nor
angered. Madeleine was laughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Arlette est très-méchante</i>—Arlette is very naughty,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert shouted with laughter as at some superlative
witticism, and both the girls looked at him rather surprised.
Then Madeleine laughed a bit, as one laughs who
does not quite see the point. Kendall watched Andree
in consternation. What would she do? What would
she say? What would she think?... She did nothing,
said nothing, apparently thought nothing, but pared a
banana with quaint intensity as if a banana were a
strange and interesting fruit. She seemed always to be
interested in her food with a sort of naïve curiosity and
a very real appetite. Her appetite seemed to Kendall
to be the only material thing about her. The rest was
mystery, dainty, rather elfin, mystery.... And here
was a new mystery—her attitude of unconcern in face of
Arlette’s <i>faux pas</i>. Why, the question had not touched
her at all! It might as well not have been asked....
Or, in this strange country, was it possible that the
<i>cuisinière</i> always expected her master’s feminine guests to
remain for breakfast as well as dinner? He wondered....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will they take Paris—the <i>boches</i>?” Andree asked,
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Germans had broken across the Chemin des Dames
and were rushing headlong toward the Marne. News was
filtering through only in driblets. Paris was uneasy. One
saw nondescript vehicles, piled with trunks and hampers,
making haste for the railroad stations, as frightened inhabitants
betook themselves to the country. Nobody
knew what would happen, but for months the fortune
had been bad—and Paris was asking if it had reached its
worst.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course not,” said Bert, dogmatically.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But they are very strong—they have great numbers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There are the Americans,” said Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To be sure—the Americans. But they are in Lorraine.
The journals say they are in Lorraine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will see,” said Madeleine, for she had more than
her share of Paris’s enthusiasm for its newest ally.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t you worry. The <i>boches</i> are going to get themselves
thrashed.... Paris!...” Bert shrugged his
shoulders disdainfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You really think they can be beaten?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just wait.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the war will end?... When will it end?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In a year.” Bert was very confident.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, a year—so long.... Monsieur Bert, it is terrible,
this war. One hardly remembers when it was not.
We are so tired of it. The women are so tired of it....
It makes me sad—sad. Everybody suffers.” Andree’s
eyes grew bigger and blacker, and her wistful mouth
became more wistful.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is true,” said Madeleine. “I have an aunt who
lives in the country—in a very little village. Before the
war were thirty families and fifty men. I was there two
years ago. The men were all at the front—all.... But
the fields were planted and the harvests reaped. It was
the women. They labored for the men.... I was
there again—it was a month ago.... The fields were
not planted. Matters were bad. It was not beautiful,
and all was neglected.... The women no longer worked.
And why? Ah, it was because there was no longer a
reason for them to work.... There were no men to come
home to those fields.... Of the fifty who went to the
war, fifty were dead.... Forever it will be a village
without men!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a silence. Every one was feeling the weight
of the calamities of war.... Then Madeleine laughed,
but it was a laugh without her customary gay, careless
ring. “This is the last generation of the French,” she
said, half mockingly. “Our men are gone.... You
shall see. The next generation will be what? Look
you. It will be English, Belgian, Italian, American,
Moroccan, Chinese....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“For example!” exclaimed Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is so,” affirmed Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Already the government offers one five hundred
francs for a son.... I think the government is satisfied
if it is half French, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A son is a son,” said Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To become a soldier when he is a man—and fight the
<i>boches</i>!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There will be no more wars,” said Bert. “When we
are through with this one nobody will ever have to fight
the <i>boches</i> again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If one could believe,” Andree said, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was disturbed. It was within his power to be
sympathetic, to feel deeply, to know pain because another
was suffering pain. He wished this subject had not arisen
and he wanted to have it changed ... because the
plight of the women—especially the young women, the
marriageable girls of France—was making itself apparent
to him. Millions of them, and no men to marry them!
It was appalling. It was appalling that they should
realize it, and the consequences of their realization were
appalling.... Life was denied them; the fullness and
beauty and the joys and sufferings of womanhood were
denied them. He wondered, with his Middle-Western
conscience, if one could really blame them for snatching
what little minutes of living came in their way. He
wondered if the conventional—in these terrible circumstances—could
be the <i>right</i>. Would the morals of
Plymouth Rock answer in this emergency?... And
then came the inevitable question, What are morals?...
His mother could not answer this question for him to
his satisfaction, nor could his father—with all his father’s
leniency. One had to see the thing to comprehend it,
and neither of his parents had seen. For the first time
he asked himself if the conventions, the cut-and-dried
rules of living under which he had grown to manhood,
really sprang, full-armed, from the will of Deity, or if they
were evolved by expediency.... It was deep speculation
for one of his equipment, and dangerous speculation for
a young man set down as he was set down among manners
strange and customs so divergent—and in such an
emergency.</p>

<p class='c006'>He moved back his chair. “Let’s go in the other
room,” he said, “and—and suppose we talk about something
besides the war.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It makes you sad?” Andree said, and looked at him
with a strange expression of sympathy, of understanding—of—of
something that made her seem nearer to him,
less mysterious, more human than she had ever seemed
before. “Come ... we shall talk awhile and then I
must go to my house, because it is ver’ <i>nécessaire</i> for me
to lift up at an early hour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall laughed. “Lift up?...” The literal translation
uttered so soberly was exquisitely funny, made more
so by Andree’s solemn little face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is fonnee? For example! And what should one
say?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Get up,” said Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not well.... I shall say lift up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may say whatever you want to—<i>mignonne</i>,” he
said, with a sudden access of tenderness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne!...</i>” She looked up at him and smiled
timidly. “It is ver’ pretty—for you to call me so. It
is ver’ well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Madeleine was singing now. She always sang, Kendall
discovered, mostly popular <i>chansons</i>. And Andree joined.
It was that song dear to the <i>poilu</i>—“<i>Madelon</i>”—with
its catchy air, its characteristic Frenchness. Madeleine
sang gaily, carelessly, Andree seriously and without
a smile.... Then the girls chattered with each other,
becoming acquainted, while the young men smoked and
tried to edge into the conversation, or to catch a stray
word here and there. At last Andree rose.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must take me to my house.” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So early?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is ver’ <i>nécessaire</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Coming?” Ken said to Bert, who cast a sidewise glance
at Madeleine, and said: “No. We don’t go your way,
anyhow.... See you later.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So Kendall and Andree said good night and went down
the stairs, counting the flights gaily, he offering to become
an elevator to carry her down if she became tired, and
she demanding that he do so at once, without delay.
“Your friend, he is a high yo’ng man,” she said, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c006'>And that became a joke between them. Ever after
that they referred to Bert, not by name, but as the “high
yo’ng man.” When people begin to have private jokes
between just themselves they are getting on very well
indeed....</p>

<p class='c006'>Once more he took her to the Place St.-Michel and a
little way up the Boulevard. There she dismissed him,
but they lingered with their good nights. She seemed
very gentle, very desirable, very sweet.... He was not
afraid of her as he had been before. Some sort of message
had traveled between them.... Kendall took the hand
she extended, then he drew her to him and kissed her.
She submitted, but did not return his kiss.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The day following to-morrow. Place de la Concorde.
Metro. <i>Sept heures.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was becoming a part of their ritual. And then she
disappeared into the darkness—whither, he did not know;
back into that mystery which was her life, from which she
emerged from time to time as mysteriously as she disappeared....
He was impressed by this mystery tonight.
He did not know her name—only Andree. She
was a sort of apparition that manifested itself daintily,
primly, conducted itself bewitchingly, and withdrew itself
into the unknown....</p>

<p class='c006'>He took the Metro back to the Étoile and walked home.
The light was burning in the hall. When he hung his
hat on the hall tree he found it still encumbered by
Madeleine’s hat and jacket....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall went to bed in a frame of mind.... Madeleine
had seemed such a <i>nice</i> girl. She <i>was</i> a nice girl. Why,
Andree had liked her.... His mother in him was
shocked, affronted. Yet, somehow, Kendall was not so
shocked as he expected himself to be. He didn’t know
how he felt ... his thoughts were a turmoil, and he kept
repeating to himself, “She <i>is</i> a nice girl ... she is a nice
girl,...” as one who is bewildered in the presence of
some incomprehensible phenomenon....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall dressed and went in to breakfast feeling
no slight awkwardness. He was apprehensive, too,
apprehensive of the <i>concierge</i>. The affair had upset him
in a complex sort of way. It had startled him, yet it had
not shocked him especially, and he was inclined to take
himself to task for not being shocked. He was disappointed,
and yet he was not disappointed in Madeleine.
Anyhow, he was reluctant to meet her, for fear that the
meeting would set him against her irrevocably and so
cause trouble between himself and Bert.... And yet he
was enjoying the experience as an experience, though
he did not quite appreciate that he was enjoying it.
Half a dozen times he said to himself, as if carrying on a
subconscious argument: “But she’s a <i>nice</i> girl.... Darn
it all, she’s a nice girl....” He was afraid a meeting
with her would dispel this impression of her niceness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert and Madeleine were already at table, waiting for
him. Bert said good morning nonchalantly, and Madeleine
smiled brightly and wished him “<i>bon jour</i>” without
the least hint of embarrassment or self-consciousness. He
was conscious of a feeling of relief. “By Jove! she is a
nice girl,” he said to himself, and took the hand which
she arose and offered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Arlette came in with the pitcher of chocolate,
and Kendall scrutinized her and then shook his head
rather bewildered. Arlette might have been serving
breakfast to the most circumspect of families. The only
thing one could say of Arlette was that she served breakfast.
She was normal, everything was normal. Kendall’s
bewilderment increased.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle Andree? Where is she?” Madeleine
asked, presently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At home,” said Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah....” Madeleine’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now listen here,” Kendall said, “Andree and I are
friends, just friends. We—how do you say it?—<i>camarades</i>.
That is all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you do not love thees Mademoiselle Andree?
Not at all?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—” Kendall hesitated and did not answer, and
Madeleine’s eyes twinkled as she went on with her cross-examination.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And thees Mademoiselle Andree—she do not love
you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I tell you we are just friends....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“For example!... I understand. You are just
friends. Oh yes. It is possible, because the French girl
she is so col’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall applied himself to his chocolate and confiture
industriously, while Madeleine looked at him with
twinkling eyes. If he failed to understand her or her
system of life and philosophy, she was equally unable
to understand him. If he found the present situation
bewildering, she, for her part, regarded him as a strange
phenomenon that bordered on the impossible. As a final
conclusion she did not believe him in the least, but thought
of him as absurdly discreet. No other solution was
possible to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>They finished breakfast and went down the four flights
of stairs, Bert and Madeleine chatting gaily, Kendall
following apprehensively, for they must pass the omniscient
eye of the <i>concierge</i>. He was inclined to make an excuse
to go back to the apartment so that he would not be
compelled to take part in the scene he feared.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert and Madeleine passed out of the big doors into
the concrete-floored passageway that led to the street,
and Kendall drew himself together as he saw the <i>concierge</i>
busily sweeping between them and the outer doors. She
looked up and nodded and smiled. Madeleine stopped
and they chatted! Actually chatted as if—why, as if
there was no reason why they should not chat. And that
<i>concierge</i> was a gray-haired, motherly soul who in Detroit
would have gone to foreign missionary meetings! Kendall
could not follow the conversation, but he caught fragments
of it. It was just casual chatter, with here and
there a question dropped in to make for a better acquaintance.
Then they bade each other good-by in the
most friendly way imaginable and the trio went out to the
street.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was suspended in mid-air, feet off the ground,
nothing solid within reach. He was in an element that
was not his, in a universe where two solids could occupy
the same place at the same time, or where the shortest
distance between two points was a curve. All his rules
and axioms were useless.... He began to realize that
the years he had lived were more or less useless to him,
and that if he wished to judge his present life and the
people among whom he lived he must start at the beginning
with an open mind. As an American he could
never comprehend them; he could not think their thoughts
nor understand their mental language. The part of him
inherited from his mother could never get into <i>rapport</i>
with France; the part inherited from his father never
could quite comprehend, though it might tolerate with
a kindly toleration, and say: “Well, I don’t understand
this way of doing things at all.... But maybe it’s all
right—for the French.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He kept glancing at Madeleine. Every glance reassured
him. She was a <i>nice</i> girl. He liked her. There
was nothing reprehensible about her, but, on the contrary,
she was charming as he liked to see a girl charming, and
modest, and <i>good</i>. He felt instinctively that she was good,
just as he had felt that Andree was good.... Somewhere
there must be an explanation. Somehow the thing
was reconcilable.</p>

<p class='c006'>They left Madeleine at the Metro and walked to their
offices. Neither boy referred to the situation; Bert,
because he saw no reason for it; Kendall, because he dared
not. Strangely, it was not Madeleine and Bert that
troubled him; it was himself. He was not accustomed to
studying himself, but he was doing so now. He had
rather fancied himself a man capable of thought and
understanding, a man who could look at the world and
comprehend it. He had regarded himself as wise in his
generation, not blatantly so, but with a certainty born
of inherited dogmas and local dogmas. For the first
time he saw dimly that one may understand the world
from the Detroit point of view and be utterly at a loss
in New York; that he may understand life from the
American point of view and be grossly ignorant of the
French. He even asked himself this question:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is one who lives up to his code of ethics, his moral
conceptions, good and moral, even if those ethics and
conceptions are utterly at variance with some other code
of behavior?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Could it be that a thing abominable in America because
America’s code was set against it could be perfectly
proper in Persia because Persia’s code permitted it? That
there was an abstract <i>good</i> he believed, and that there
was an abstract <i>evil</i>. But could a definite act be made
universally evil by legislation or by the custom of only
a part of the world? It was deeper reasoning than he had
ever essayed before, and he limped sadly as he traveled
toward no conclusion at all. The result was multiplied
bewilderment....</p>

<p class='c006'>One conclusion he reached: If Madeleine had been an
American girl he would have been shocked, outraged....
This led him to think of Maude Knox, and suddenly he
wanted to see her, to talk to her, to be with her because
she was American as he was American. He wanted to
get his feet on solid earth and to tread accustomed paths
for a while. He determined he would see her.</p>

<p class='c006'>At noon he told Bert he would not be at home for dinner,
and then at six o’clock he hurried to the Hôtel Wagram
and telephoned Miss Knox’s room. She was in, and
would be delighted to dine with him if he would wait
twenty minutes. He sat down in the spacious lobby and
smoked and waited.</p>

<p class='c006'>She came down the stairs very trim and American and
pleasing to the eye. He noted the little swagger—the rather
charming swagger—to her walk. It was accentuated
by the fact that she carried her hands in the side pockets
of her coat. She was not in uniform; had left it off
for the evening as the women in the various services love
to do. He arose and walked to the stairway to meet her,
and they shook hands in the frank American way.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well?” she said, with a humorous twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I got to wanting to see you this morning,” he said,
“and it grew. So I just came along and took a chance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To-morrow would be too late. I’ve got a job with a
combat division and I’m going out to-morrow. Maybe
I’ll get close to the front.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Congratulations. You’re luckier than I.... We’ll
make this a celebration. Where would you like to eat?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Any place.... I don’t care—somewhere where
we won’t see an American.... Have you seen the
papers?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. I’ve been grubbing all day, but a hint of the news
has dribbled in to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you’ve heard that the Hun is stopped! And
that we did it. Isn’t that glorious? We—Americans—saved
Paris. I wonder if it can be true.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They bought a <i>Herald</i> from a kiosk and found a brief,
unsatisfactory, much-censored story, but it was a confirmation.
The marines had been in it. Apparently they
had been thrown in to stop a gap, and had stopped
it effectively. Kendall knew that this meant the second
division, comprising two regiments of marines and some
of the old Regular Army. They had been thrown across
the Paris-Metz road—and the <i>boches</i> had been halted
abruptly. It was glorious, thrilling news.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How would you like to go to a little restaurant where
I eat once in a while? It’s very Parisian. There will
be no Americans there, and while it doesn’t look much,
the food is bully and the crowd amusing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fine!” she said, and he stopped a passing taxicab.
By dint of many repetitions he was able to make the
chauffeur comprehend that he wanted to be driven to
Marty’s on the rue de Richelieu.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were a trifle early. Few of the regular <i>habitués de
maison</i> were present yet, and they had their choice of
tables. Ken selected the one at which he had sat the
other evening. One by one the regulars appeared and,
recognizing Kendall, smiled and nodded. Monsieur
Robert appeared with the Spanish tragedian, and Monsieur
Robert came over to shake hands and be very cordial.
Ken presented him to Maude and watched her
face with amusement when the handsome young actor
bent over her hand and kissed it. Then entered the elderly
critic with the pointed white beard who was invariably
accompanied by a beautiful girl—a new beautiful
girl every evening. And then appeared Monsieur
Jacques, swinging his artificial leg hilariously, waving his
cane, and with his hat awry, as was its custom. He
shouted greetings to all, then, espying Kendall, he rushed
to his chair, clapped the captain on the back, and, turning,
harangued the room. His subject was Americans. The
Americans were heroic. They had appeared in France’s
hour of need. They were shedding their blood in France’s
quarrel, and France should proclaim her gratitude. Had
not these so-much-to-be-loved Americans saved Paris
from the <i>boche</i>. But certainly! That very day....
<i>Vive l’Amérique!...</i> Suddenly, in a transport of enthusiasm,
he threw his arm about Kendall’s neck and
kissed him resoundingly on both cheeks....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was frightfully embarrassed, especially when
he heard the room laugh until the dishes rocked. He was
angry, but before he could give vent to his anger his eye
encountered Maude Knox, mirthful tears rolling down
her cheeks. Then he himself laughed, if a bit ruefully.
Jacques threw himself into a seat across the table and
began talking in his wild way to Maude Knox, who
spoke French very well indeed. There was no need for
introductions here. Jacques never thought of such a
thing and Maude appeared perfectly willing to forgo
the ceremony. Kendall was rather out of it temporarily.
He looked across at Monsieur Robert, who was bobbing
his head and laughing and writing on the back of a
<i>carte de jour</i>.... Then he arose and handed it to
Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>Monsieur had a trifle of English of which he was very
proud, and this communication, relating to Jacques,
was couched in that language. Ken read it and then
laughed in real earnest, for it made this rather amazing
announcement:</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not a bad boy, but he is a few mad!”</p>

<p class='c006'>What more could one ask of a single sentence?</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you are looking for something un-American you
get it here,” he said to Maude.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I like it.... I’m enjoying every second of it,” she
said, delightedly. “They’re just like children.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But Jacques here has an artificial leg, a silver plate in
the crown of his head, the Médaille Militaire and the
Croix de Guerre,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jacques, meantime, had possessed himself of Monsieur
Robert’s note and, leaping to his feet, was heaping scorn
and derision on the young actor’s head, while Monsieur
Robert feigned terror and made as though he would hide
under the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are they always like this,” Maude asked, “or is it
relief—now that Paris seems to be safe?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are always so,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I envy them.... But it couldn’t happen in America,
could it? Imagine this in Cleveland or Detroit. Why,
everybody would be put out by the management, or the
police would be called in! And why?... I’m learning a
lot since I came to France.... There’s something in the
very air here. One could do things never dreamed of at
home.... I don’t know what it is, but that’s the way I
feel. Maybe it is the freedom from restraint, maybe it’s
the example, maybe it is that the war is so tremendous
that nothing a single individual can do is of the least
importance.... But the feeling is there. Other girls
have told me the same thing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Paris does get you,” said Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Things don’t seem to matter,” she said, thoughtfully.
“It’s like being in a different world where none of the
old rules hold good.... I can’t imagine myself talking
like this or feeling like this. I couldn’t have a month ago....
I think,” she said, with a little laugh, “that I shall
have to keep my head very level.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken was astonished. So the thing was getting Maude
Knox, too! She saw a difference, felt a difference, felt
the challenge of a difference! “It gets you.... It gets
you,” he said, helplessly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sometimes I have a feeling that I’d like to throw up
the whole show and live here forever—be a lotus-eater,”
she said, with more seriousness. “If I were a man—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She shrugged her shoulders. “What’s the use?...
But I’ll say this—I’m never going to see things with the
same eyes again. I think I’ll be able to understand that
there are two sides to a story.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This was the same Maude Knox he had known on the
vessel crossing the ocean—a Maude Knox who quite
typified his ideas of the <i>nice</i> American girl, the sheltered,
protected, almost prudish creature of his experience!
She had traveled far—and yet she was not less nice because
she had seen more of the life that inhabits the planet,
nor because she had acquired a certain tolerance for
manners and customs that were impossible for herself.
It seemed as if she were passing through much the same
mental conflict as himself. Perhaps it was not so pronounced
with her because her experiences had not been so
pronounced. But she seemed to have reached a surer
conclusion than he. However, she had never had his
mother. Her inheritances were different, and her upbringing
by her philosopher father had, perhaps, made it
possible for her to progress more rapidly in understanding
and clear seeing than himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For instance,” she said, “if I had met you with that
little French girl a month ago I should probably have cut
you.... Especially when you wore such a guilty
look....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It wasn’t a guilty look. I—Andree is a mighty nice
girl. I introduced her to you, didn’t I?... Well?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her eyes twinkled. He could not decide whether it
were derision or unbelief, and he felt very uncomfortable
in consequence. “Just because she’s French ...” he
commenced.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The young man doth protest too much,” she said.
“But what I was going to say was that it didn’t seem to
matter in the least. I suppose it ought to, but it didn’t....
She looked like such a nice, sweet little thing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And that’s why the life here in Paris is so bewildering.
It upsets all one’s preconceived notions. It makes one
wonder....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It does,” he said, emphatically.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I presume I should be just as intolerant back home as
I ever was.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s different back home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Extremely,” she said, dryly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jacques turned suddenly to Maude as the male dressmaker
came in with his pink-cheeked companion of the
other night. “You see her,” he said, as one about to
make a statement of distinct interest to the one addressed.
“She ees his girl—yes.... I theenk she look for anozzer
boy. Bicause thees dressmaker, he is ver’ selfish. He
make mooch money, but he theenk only of himself. It ees
so.... For example!... He make that yo’ng girl do
<i>so</i>—how you say?” He went through the pantomime
of shining his shoes. “That ees not pleasant. <i>N’est-ce
pas?...</i> So I theenk she look about for anozzer
boy....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall felt his ears growing hot, and was on the point
of committing an indiscretion when Maude answered with
a quaver of mirth in her voice, and not the least of the
anger and shocked indignation Kendall expected. “I
should think she would....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently Kendall called for the check and they went
out, Jacques insisting on shaking hands with both of
them, and appearing to be on the point of kissing Ken
all over again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How shall we keep up the celebration?” Ken asked
when they were out on the dark, narrow street.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s walk,” she said. “Paris fascinates me at night.
I love to stroll about, but usually I have to go in so
early. Are you too tired to walk up the Champs Élysées
and possibly on to the Bois de Boulogne?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed not!” he said, and they started off with good
American strides, dodging taxicabs that came charging
down upon them out of the darkness with lights so dim
as to be scarcely visible, and almost bumping into pedestrians
who loomed up suddenly out of the blackness
ahead. In a few moments they emerged upon the
broader thoroughfares where visibility was higher, and
presently were walking up the rue de Rivoli toward the
Étoile.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was feeling a new and different interest in
Maude Knox. He had been attracted to her casually
on the boat, for she had been very pleasant to look at, and
a charming companion. But she had not impressed him
other than with a mild pleasantness, calling forth a
temporary friendliness. To-night he felt that he really
<i>liked</i> her; that there was something to her. She had
disclosed that there was a certain kinship between their
mental processes and their reactions to the new life that
surrounded them, but most of all she had shown herself
adaptable and <i>sensible</i>. Sensible covered a multitude of
meanings for Ken. His idea of girls was that they were
creatures full of peculiar concealments and inhibitions
who had a habit of looking at facts obliquely and interpreting
them without frankness. Somehow they never
seemed exactly sincere to him, but rather as if they felt
compelled to certain pretenses as a measure of self-protection.
His impression was that American girls were
always conscious of the necessity for protecting themselves,
and this destroyed comradeship and good understanding....
It was his notion that they were constantly on their
guard against a danger which they rather feared did not
exist....</p>

<p class='c006'>But to-night Maude Knox seemed very different from
all this; she seemed frank and fearless. She had seen
more than her sisters back home, and it had not shocked
her especially. She was capable of entering into the
spirit of the life—at least theoretically—and she treated
him, Kendall, as an equal and a friend rather than as a
male to be kept in his place lest he pounce upon her with
dire consequences.... He liked it. He liked the way she
talked, and he liked the air with which she carried herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Half an hour later they were seated on uncomfortable
iron chairs beside the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne, watching
a string of American ambulances whiz by from the
hospital beyond, on their way to one of the stations to
meet a train bearing wounded from the front.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It makes one realize that we’re in it,” Maude said,
gravely. “It hardly seems possible that those ambulances
will be back in an hour filled with American boys—wounded
in France by the Germans. There’s something
unreal about it.... To think that those boys have
crossed the ocean to be wounded and mutilated over here!...
I wonder if they are sending any of the wounded
home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The folks won’t realize this war till they see boys on
crutches....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before them the promenaders straggled, dim forms in
the dusk, only to be distinguished when they passed within
reach of the arm. There were parties of three or four
girls of the working-class hurrying home with packages
under their arms; there were other parties who dawdled
and laughed and jostled one another and giggled—young
shop or factory girls out to enjoy the evening. There
were young men and young women who walked very
close to each other, sometimes holding hands. There
were single young men and young men in pairs out for
walk and adventure. There were officers of all armies
and a sprinkling of American doughboys ready for whatever
might happen, often three or four of them with a
single girl, all jolly and laughing and having the most
enjoyable sort of time trying to make themselves understood
to one another. At a little distance two neat-looking
girls were seriously giving a French lesson to a
group of American soldiers.... It was such a company
of strollers and dawdlers as the concerns of the world had
never brought together before, drawn from all habitable
quarters of the globe because the Hun, in his ruthless
ambition, had thought to spread his <i>Kultur</i> over the face
of the planet....</p>

<p class='c006'>There were long lapses in the conversation, for both
Maude and Kendall found a gripping interest in the
passers-by.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just think,” said Maude, presently, “almost every
girl we see has lost a father or a brother or a sweetheart
or a husband. Almost every one.... A waitress in our
hotel told me this morning that eleven men of her family
were dead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But somehow the thing that—that <i>frightens</i> me most
is not to think of the women who have lost fathers and
brothers, or even husbands.... It is the girls who have
lost sweethearts. It is the thought of the boys who are
dead and who were to have been the husbands of these
girls.... Think of the hundreds of them who have
lost husbands whom, perhaps, they have never met ...
whom they can never meet.... It’s awful to think of a
million girls who have <i>got</i> to be old maids! They don’t
want to be, but they’ve <i>got</i> to be.... War has taken
from them the husbands they never had.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve thought of that,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It means these girls have lost more than life—they
have had killed for them the possibility of living.... They
can never have homes and families.... The future is
nothing but a stretch of years for them—lonesome years
without happiness and without sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose it is as hard to be deprived of sorrow as it
is of happiness,” said Kendall, slowly.</p>

<p class='c006'>She paused before replying. “Yes,” she said, “I can
understand that—if the sorrow is brought because you
love. Sorrow is a necessary experience of life. Emerson’s
essay on compensation is all about that....” She
paused again and then broke out with a vehemence
foreign to her. “I don’t blame them—I don’t blame them
a bit. Everybody is entitled to live and to have the
experiences of life. I never thought I should feel this
way, but it is <i>so</i>.... If you can have a life full of living
you are entitled to snatch your little moments of happiness—just
as these French girls are doing. It is their right,
because it is the best life has to offer them.... It isn’t
France alone—it might happen in America. Suppose
half the girls at home were deprived of the possibility of
marriage.... It’s awful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The little moments of happiness! Kendall’s mind
seized on that phrase and held it.... It was the essence
of the whole matter. These women, shut out from the
Banquet of Life, were seizing hungrily the crumbs of
happiness that were brushed from the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the pause that followed an American soldier and a
French girl sat down in the chairs at the right of Maude
and Kendall and talked jerkily, half in French, half in
English. They tried so hard to talk to each other,
because each was lonesome.... And then, as Kendall
and Maude eavesdropped shamelessly, the siren sounded—the
<i>Gothas</i> were coming!</p>

<p class='c006'>People started to their feet and began scurrying away
to seek for shelter, but Maude and Kendall did not move,
nor did the boy and girl next them. Presently Kendall
heard the boy ask, “Ain’t you afraid of the bombs,
mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non.... Non....</i>” She shrugged her shoulders
and then said, in a hopeless voice, a pitiful voice: “I have
not the fear, because what does it matter?... There is
nothing in life for me. If I am kill—<i>pouf!... So....</i>
There is an end, and it will be well....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall felt Maude’s fingers on his arm, felt their
sudden pressure. “There,” she whispered. “There it
is.... She <i>knows</i>. They all know.... Who has a
right to say they sha’n’t have their little moments?...”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall stood up. It seemed as if movement were
necessary, any sort of movement, of physical action. This
sudden, close contact with terrible reality had seared
through to his consciousness with a terrible, burning
depression.... The thing was unbearable.... And
this, he thought, is what war means!...</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come,” he said, almost roughly.</p>

<p class='c006'>She arose obediently and they walked rapidly toward
the Étoile.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have fifteen minutes,” he said. “If we walk fast
we can almost make your hotel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As they walked the now almost deserted streets, deserted
except for stragglers and for taxicabs which went
scurrying about as they always do, not oblivious to bomb
raids, but in defiance of them, they saw huge, mysterious
bodies arising from the shrubbery, great grub-shapes that
appeared from nowhere and mounted high into the
heavens—the sausage balloons which in time of raid
stretch in interminable line across the sky down the path
of the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne and the Champs
Élysées and the Jardin des Tuileries. They were so silent,
so mysterious, such ghostly-gray blots against the sky!</p>

<p class='c006'>They reached the Place de la Concorde before the first
gun of the barrage sounded, and in a moment were safely
under the arches of the buildings that face the rue de
Rivoli.... And then the storm broke in all its fury.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall waited for Maude’s reactions. It was a sort of
test. There was danger, real danger, even under those
huge stone arches—if a bomb should strike directly above
them or in the street without. He wanted to see how she
would behave in presence of danger.</p>

<p class='c006'>She satisfied him. She exhibited, not fear, but curiosity
and a childlike interest, as if it were some sort of spectacle,
and she were disappointed at not having a better seat.
It was impossible to keep her back from the curb, for she
insisted on standing in the very mouth of the arch to see
all that was to be seen.... She had courage as well as
frankness and understanding. His admiration for her
grew amazingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>In an hour the raid was over and they continued their
way to the Hôtel Wagram.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good night,” she said, extending her hand and giving
him a pressure of real friendship. “I’ve enjoyed this
evening—more than any other since I’ve been here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It has been bully,” he said. “I feel as if I were just
getting acquainted with you.... It’s hard luck you’re
going so soon—but you’ll be back.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed. “You won’t be lonesome,” she said,
gaily. “There’s that cunning little French girl of yours—who
doesn’t seem to have any last name.... Mademoiselle
Andree.” She laughed again. “What is her last
name? You know it isn’t usual to introduce strangers
by their given names, as you did.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He laughed ruefully. “I’m darned if I know,” he said.
“I always forget to ask her.” It was a reply that would
have been impossible for him to make to Maude Knox six
hours before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her face grew serious and she touched his arm with her
fingers lightly. “She had a sweet face,” Maude said.
“Don’t be unkind to her.... Now good night. To-morrow
I’ll be where I can hear the guns.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good night,” he said, and turned away.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was repeating to himself what Maude had said:
“Don’t be unkind to her.... Don’t be unkind to her.”
What was he to do? How was he to deal with that quaint
little person who appeared out of mystery to assume such
an important place in his life?... Was not merely knowing
her being unkind to her?... Or was he giving her her
little moment of happiness?...</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>All day Kendall had been comparing Maude Knox
with Andree. When he left the American girl and
went home to his apartment he had been under the spell
of her American manner, of her frankness, of the undefinable
something which one finds in all American girls
of the college type, of the cultured type, which is to be
found in no other women the world over. When you
have called it the American manner you have done your
best at description.... It was the old story of like
calling to like, of that to which one is accustomed seeming
to be more desirable than even the most delightful of
novelties. It was the call of home, the call of race, a
thing that can never be negligible in the affairs of mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>A night of sleep rounded the sharp peaks of his impressions.
When he awoke in the morning he did not see
Maude Knox so distinctly, but an impression remained
with him that would be permanent—that she was splendid,
desirable, the sort of girl a fellow would like to be very
well acquainted with. He went no farther than that.
He was not so near to being in love with her as he was
with Andree, or, if he were, he failed to recognize it....
He did recognize that Andree had become an important
personage in his life, so important that he could not
think of another girl without thinking immediately of her.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was everything that Maude Knox was not and
Maude Knox seemed to be everything that Andree was
not. There was no single point at which their characters
converged and ran parallel—except that both were “nice”....
And even their “niceness” was different. Kendall
understood Maude’s niceness perfectly; Andree’s was a
mystery to him; it was something he felt, but could not
set down in any known terms.</p>

<p class='c006'>One could readily imagine Maude playing golf or
swimming or driving a car furiously and capably; it was
impossible to imagine Andree doing any of these things.
Andree was utterly feminine. One could be pals with
Maude; with Andree, Kendall felt one could be bare
acquaintance or sweetheart—nothing else.... One felt
that Andree would give and give and give, asking only
love in return: Maude would give and give, but would
demand, as American women do, a like amount of giving
in return.</p>

<p class='c006'>Also, in the attraction which Andree exercised were the
elements of mystery and of danger. It was something
that he knew nothing about her; that she appeared as
out of nothingness, and then disappeared into black
night again—and that he was apprehensive as to where
his acquaintance with her was leading him. To a young
man of some imagination these two factors were compelling....
The more he thought of the girls that day the
stronger grew his desire to be with Andree—to taste the
charm of her presence and to sense the mystery that
surrounded her, the mystery of herself and the mystery
of a great race, apparent in her, and not understandable
by him.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was at the place of meeting early and there paced
back and forth before the entrance to subterranean
Paris, watching the crowds and waiting with impatience.
The crowd was an old story to him now, but it never
quite lost its fascination, never quite laid aside that air
of unreality, of <i>foreignness</i>, of eventfulness that made the
Paris throng of those days what it was—foreign in the
eyes of the foreigner and foreign in the eyes of the
Parisian.... He saw a slender girl—she seemed not
more than twenty—bidding farewell to a youthful soldier.
Their good-by was unrestrained and affecting. He was
going to the north—to the battle-line—and always was
the possibility that he might never return. It spoke
eloquently in the fervor of that farewell.... They stood,
locked in each other’s arms while their lips met again
and again—with all the world to see. But none pointed
or smiled. The world understood, and the heart of the
world moved in sympathy.... Here was another girl
who might never know the joys of wife or mother. If that
young man did not return, she, fortunate in the possession
of a sweetheart, might descend from her high place of
happiness and security to the drab, hopeless level of her
million sisters.... It was no ordinary parting—it was
a parting with more than a loved one, for it was a possible
parting with the right to live....</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Andree appeared, in white once more, walking
with tiny, demure little steps, unsmiling, apparently unconscious
that she was not alone on that crowded corner.
So she always came. At one moment she was not there;
the next moment she appeared—from her mystery—appeared
so modestly, so diffidently. Kendall said to
himself that she came like some fairy, afraid lest a hostile
glance or a human touch might send her back all too
soon to the fairyland whence she came....</p>

<p class='c006'>He advanced to meet her and, as she always did, she
stopped as if startled, raised her eyes to his gravely, as
if she had never seen him before, and then smiled that
little smile which seemed to say that she was uncertain
of her welcome, but hoped she would find it warm. Her
slender hand was in his, with quaint formality, and she
said in French: “Good-day, monsieur. How carry you
yourself?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very well. Very well. And you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I have been bored! I have had to make a visit
of duty. It was very tiresome....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then came the short, awkward pause while they adjusted
themselves to each other and sought for words in languages
strange with which to begin conversation. It was always
so—that they spoke little for the first five minutes after a
meeting. Neither seemed to find words to begin. Then
she said, looking at him sidewise, with the merest hint
of a smile in her lovely eyes, “Have you thought of me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When I lifted up.” He laughed at this quotation of
her literal translation of the French for <i>arise</i>. “In the
morning, at noon, all the afternoon—always.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well,” she said. “I also have thought of you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where shall we eat?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not care.... It makes nothing.... Is Arlette
well?” She laughed a little at recollection of Arlette.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a few moments they walked along undecided, and
then Kendall looked up to see Monsieur Robert approaching.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here’s your actor,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What actor, monsieur?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Monsieur Robert.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know heem?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I told you about him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.... Yes.... That was well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Monsieur Robert recognized Kendall, and looked
quickly at Andree; then he smiled and waggled his head
in the charming, boyish way he had, and lifted his hat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good night,” he said, making a display of his English
and extending his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Monsieur Robert, permit me, Mademoiselle Andree.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The young actor took her hand and, with a smile that
was half a laugh, bowed over it and made some response
in French which was not intelligible to Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle wishes to enter your profession,”
Kendall said, with a twinkle in his eye. “She is going to
the <i>Académie</i> in September.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah....” Monsieur Robert looked at her more
carefully. “You enter the <i>Académie</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know—I hope.... I am working very hard.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you wish to be an actress?... It is well. But
why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So she can come to New York, <i>à la</i> Madame Bernhardt,
and bring home much money, and be too proud to know
an old friend like myself when I sit in the front row and
applaud.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She smiled up at him. “When I come in New York you
will go to see me?... But I shall be very great and
famous. Oh yes. But I shall remember you, of a surety....
I shall remember you—a little.” There was an
infinity of subdued roguishness about her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Monsieur Robert was studying Andree with interest.
“You will be ver’ pretty actress,” he said, haltingly,
speaking in English so that Kendall would share in the
compliment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You bet,” said Ken, spontaneously, and then, with
characteristic American directness: “What’s this about the
necessity for having some actor speak for her? She says
she cannot enter unless some actor says a good word for
her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It makes the matter with more facility,” said Monsieur
Robert.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree looked from Kendall to the young actor timidly,
almost with the shyness of a child.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why not come and dine with us?” said Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should be delighted, but it is not possible for me to-night.
I am—how you say?—<i>très-occupé</i>.... But some
other night—very soon.... With mademoiselle.” He waggled
his head again and laughed his pleasing, boyish laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shall we say to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, very well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it is possible for mademoiselle,” and Kendall looked
at Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, “to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At Marty’s,” said Monsieur Robert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Seven o’clock?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well.... <i>Au revoir, mademoiselle et monsieur.</i>
Until to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently Kendall stopped. “By Jove!” he said, “I
forgot to tell Arlette I wouldn’t be home to dinner. She
will have it ready. Shall we dine with her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As you like.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And afterward we can sit and talk.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, if only you can speak more French.... There
are so many things we could speak of. I should like to
talk of many things to you—and to read you poems....
You know French poets?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken shook his head. “You like poetry, don’t you?...
I’ll bet you’re a poet yourself? Don’t you make
poems?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“One leetle book,” she said, with a rueful shake of the
head. “One leetle, small book.... But it was not
good—oh no. In it are only two poems that are good.
The rest are bad, ver’, ver’ bad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t believe a word of it. I’ll bet they’re great.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non ... non!...</i> I will bring them to you and
you shall see.... But no. It is not possible for you to
read. I am so sad ... so sad.” She laughed a little
to show that she was not sad at all, and tripped along by
his side, almost instantly returning to that quaint gravity
which always baffled Kendall. He never could tell
whether it was real gravity or a sort of protective coloring
such as birds use to make themselves invisible to the
hostile eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>As they descended into the Metro they met, coming up
the stairs, a handsomely dressed young woman, exquisitely
shod, but so painted as to cheeks that one could not
possibly imagine what her natural complexion might
have been. She looked at Kendall boldly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Camouflage,” said Andree, serenely, when the young
woman had passed. “I do not like ...”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not the first time Kendall had heard that Parisian
term applied to the painted face, but he laughed now as if
it were a fresh witticism to him. Andree made it fresh,
for any sort of slang sounded so unnatural from her lips
as to be irresistibly ludicrous ... like the harmless
precocity of a child.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Vous êtes très-jolie</i>,” he said, with decision.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.... I am not pretty. You do not theenk.
You make mock of me.” And then, as he wrinkled his
nose: “Oh, why do you make <i>grimace</i>?... It is not
nice for make <i>grimace</i> at me.... And now—oh, I see—your
left eye it laughs, and the other it does not. Why is
that? Why does your left eye laugh?” She pointed
accusingly at the offending eye and stopped still, shaking
her head. “Oh, you are ver’ bad. I do not like you....
No.... No.... I do not like you.” And then
she laughed with that sudden change from mock gravity
to delicious merriment of which she alone, of all the people
Kendall knew, was capable.</p>

<p class='c006'>When she did that she was so alluring, so cunning, that
Kendall had to hold his arms stiff at his sides to prevent
them from picking her up and cuddling her and kissing
her.... It seemed that humor of hers was given her
to tempt kisses. Yet there was nothing deliberately
provocative about her, nothing. Quite the contrary. It
seemed rather her desire to suppress such things as
demonstrations of affection than to provoke them.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the apartment the <i>concierge</i> bowed and smiled to
them, and wished them a good evening. Up-stairs
Arlette was manifestly upset by the appearance of an
unexpected guest, but Andree disappeared into the
kitchen, whence emerged a whirlwind of chatter, and all
was well.... Bert was just finishing shaving.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Andree, eh?” he said. “Why didn’t you tip me off,
and I’d have gathered up Madeleine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know.... I—” Kendall was thinking about
the other night.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Piffle!” said Bert. Then, “Do you mean to tell me—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I certainly do mean to tell you,” Ken said, belligerently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You get me, young fellow. You sure do....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, dry up, and come to dinner—and behave if you
can manage it.” Kendall went into the <i>salon</i> to rejoin
Andree, more than a little apprehensive of the future
if it should throw Andree and Madeleine together.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree was looking about the room with humorous
toleration from a seat in the outrageous piece of furniture
which she had claimed as her throne. “Mademoiselle
Madeleine—she is not here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not well. Go and fetch her.... Now.... At
once. Or I shall go away.” She shook her head and
made stiff little gestures with her hand, but when he
stood in front of her she twinkled at him and placed
both hands in his when he held them out toward her.
He retained them a moment and then raised them to
his lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re a sweet child,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I do not onderstan’....I do not know....
Where is the <i>dictionnaire</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No matter.... There’s Arlette announcing dinner.”
It was Arlette’s custom to poke her head through the
door when dinner was ready and to stare into the room
silently and a little affrightedly. She never spoke. It
was necessary to watch for the appearance of her head
if one wanted to know when the meal was served.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert came in and Andree asked after Madeleine’s health
as if she considered Bert personally responsible for it,
demanding why she was not present.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ken’s afraid you don’t like her,” Bert said, mischievously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mais oui.... Mais oui.</i> I do like. I like ver’
much. Why you theenk?” She turned to Ken with the
question.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t pay any attention to Bert. He thinks he has
a sense of humor,” Ken said, but his ears were red,
nevertheless, a circumstance which did not escape Andree’s
sharp eyes. She let the matter pass and addressed herself
to her food with that detachment from all other matters
which always brought a smile to Kendall’s face. There
were so many quaint, delightful attributes in her....</p>

<p class='c006'>Toward the end of the dinner the diners heard a subdued
whispering and giggling without, and then appeared
little Arlette, bearing a dessert—a wonderful dessert. It
was a pudding with a white frothiness of beaten egg covering
it. It was a real dessert—the first, if one excepts
fruit and ices without authority, that Ken had seen since
he came to France. Little Arlette carried it to the table,
and stood, big-eyed, mouth pursed, waiting for the
astonishment which the miracle was to cause....
Arlette herself, wiping her chin on the back of her hand
and grinning with delight, allowed her head to be seen
through the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is from the <i>concierge</i>,” she said, very rapidly. “She
sends it to messieurs with her compliments.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now that’s mighty nice. You thank her, Arlette, and
we’ll thank her when we go down.... I guess we haven’t
made a hit with madame, eh?... And, <i>mignonne</i>! We
must have another place, Arlette, and a spoon. But <i>mignonne</i>
does not like pudding, eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Oui</i>,” said little Arlette, her eyes growing even bigger,
and the pucker turning into a smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall settled the child at table and then gravely
introduced her to Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She goes to America with me, you are to understand.
I am about to ask Arlette for this young lady’s hand.
But yes. We are very fond of each other. Is it not so,
mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur,” replied little Arlette, very gravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!... Oh!... You are ver’ naughty. I am
jealous. I shall not stay. I shall go away.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Little Arlette observed her gravely. “Monsieur will
be my husband,” she said. “It is arranged.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor myself!... I am sad. I shall to weep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette looked at Andree interestedly and expectantly
and cheerfully, not displeased to have caused this frightful
storm of jealousy and well prepared to rejoice in the
tears of her defeated rival.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall carried the mite into the other room and
placed her on the sofa between himself and Andree, where
she snuggled up to him with a charming little air of proprietorship.
Andree bent suddenly to kiss the child, and
then turned her head away and gazed out of the window....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now you shall sing for me,” said Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little Arlette stood very erect and sang in a sweet
little voice that carried the airs very accurately, sang
the songs of the street and the music-halls and of the
<i>poilus</i>, while her grandmother stood just within the
dining-room, wrapping and unwrapping her pudgy hands
in her apron and grinning and nodding her head with
enormous pride. The child sang with great seriousness,
her head a little back, looking for all the world like a bird
on the nest opening its beak for the mother bird to drop
in a worm.... When she was through, and both Andree
and Arlette laughed at some of the songs especially,
though Ken could not understand a word, he put a franc
in her hand and kissed her. Andree snatched her up and
held her close and murmured in her ear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come now,” said Arlette, and the baby shook hands
ceremoniously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must begin to get ready to go to America,”
Kendall said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur,” she responded, and went out, turning
at every step to wave her hand in farewell.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert came back into the room, cap in hand, and said
good night.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And what shall we do?” Kendall asked when he was
gone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We shall sit and talk,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>“About what?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You shall tell to me many things.... If there really
is a building of fifty stories high in New York, and when
the war will finish, and if actors make much money in
America, and also dancers.... Here the dancers do
not make much money. Even the best.... <i>Non....</i>
A few—yes. Madame Duncan.... But in <i>Amérique</i>—is
it not the same?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They earn lots of money—heaps.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know. They just do. People go to see them.
Why don’t they make much money here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She shook her head. “I do not know. The people
they do not go for see a dancer.... Maybe, if I cannot
enter into the <i>Conservatoire</i>, I shall become a dancer and
take myself to <i>Amérique</i>. But that is very hard....
One must start in the music-halls, and I do not like.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should say <i>not</i>.” Kendall thought of her in the
atmosphere of the Paris music-hall and his soul revolted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>” she asked again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle Pourquoi.... Because you are a nice
child, and the music-halls are not nice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She smiled at him. “You theenk I am nice?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think so many things about you...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I do not onderstan’.” Her mock despair was
very pathetic until her sudden laughter changed it to
delight. In revenge she discharged a volley of rapid
French at him for two minutes. “You see?... It is
not nice to not onderstan’. You must <i>es</i>-tudy French
ver’ hard, and I will <i>es</i>-tudy English so w’en I go to
New York...”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her mood changed. “I am sad—ver’ sad.... Life,
it is not good.... No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Life is mighty confusing,” he said. “Why are you sad?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I am <i>solitaire</i>—and because there is so much
miserable. <i>Oui....</i> There is little happiness—only <i>les
petites minutes</i>.... But all the time life is not well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>petites minutes</i>!... The little minutes! There it
was again, the same thought that Maude Knox had put
into words. The little moments of happiness. Andree
searched for them, too. She felt that the best life had to
offer her were rare and transitory moments of joy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pauvre petite!</i>” he said, and took her hand. “You
should be always glad. It isn’t right for you to be sad.
You weren’t built to be sad.... It’s rotten.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, pensively, not understanding all his
words, but comprehending their meaning from his tone.</p>

<p class='c006'>It filled him with anger to think of this child whom
sorrow had no right to touch for years—to think of her
life as clouded at the moment when it should have been
filled with joys. It was unfair.... Life had no right
to treat her so. Sympathy and tenderness moved him,
and he placed his arm about her and drew her to him.
She did not resist, nor did she respond, even when he
turned her face upward and kissed her. Her lips were
cold.... If nothing but little minutes of happiness
were possible for her, he vowed in his heart that he would
make them more numerous.</p>

<p class='c006'>He continued to hold her, and she lay in his arms
unresisting while he whispered to her as he would have
whispered to an unhappy child—yet not as he would have
whispered to a child. The touch of her, her nearness,
her sweet fragility mounted to his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I want you to be very happy ... because I love
you,” he said, and, saying it, he believed it. There was
room in his thoughts for nothing but her in that moment.
Inhibitions were forgotten, apprehensions laid aside—the
youth in his heart cried out to the youth in her heart—nothing
remained but youth and love and a great sympathy.
He did not look to the future. The sharp voice
of conscience, suspicious, narrow, inherited from his
mother, was silenced. Not that he was consciously
running counter to the demands of that conscience!
He was living that minute with no thought of what the
next minute might bring....</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree freed herself and looked at him gravely, with
a sad scrutiny. “No,” she said. “You do not love me....
It is not possible.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I do.... I do.... Don’t you love me a little—just
a little?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh,” she said in a little voice, “I am afraid....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Afraid? ... Of what?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know.... I am so <i>solitaire</i>—so lonely—and
I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you love me—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non!... Non!...</i> You do not love me. You only
say. And if I love you—in a week, in two week, you go
away to <i>Amérique</i> and leave me to be more <i>solitaire</i>....
I should be more sad....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” he declared, and was about to expostulate and
to declare that he would never leave her, but the words
would not come. His mother had stepped in. “You will
love me,” he declared, in spite of his mother. “We will
love each other—and there will be happiness.... If
the best we can have is little moments of happiness, let
us have all we can of them.” He was honest, thought
he was being honest in his sophistry.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You would go away—in a week, in a month....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no!”</p>

<p class='c006'>He saw that she was crying, and suddenly she turned
from him to bury her face in her arms and to sob quietly,
not unrestrainedly, but with such a quietness as went
with powerful impulse to his heart, and he gathered her
to him again and tried to comfort her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why do you cry? What is it, <i>mignonne</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She shook her head. “I do not know,” she said, but
he knew that she did know and would not tell. “I will
go home now.... I am sad, and you will not like me
when I am sad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I like you any way you choose to be,” he said, holding
her close. She did not respond to his caresses, neither
did she repulse them. She was simply negative, as if they
were not happening to her at all. “I love you,” he
repeated, insistently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No....” She wiped her eyes and got to her feet.
“I must go to my house. Will you come?” she asked,
shyly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course.... But—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.... No.... You do not love me. You cannot.
I do not believe—and I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked down the street in silence. Kendall tried
to talk, but grew discouraged, for Andree was intent,
thinking, thinking, thinking, and would not talk....
He wondered if it were the end of matters between them,
if he had been too impetuous and had frightened her away.
The thought frightened him, and he tried to reassure her,
but could find no words. He did not know how to
reassure her, because he did not know what she feared
or what she was thinking.... How was he to understand?
His eyes were not clear to see into her world,
or his intelligence to understand it. He had declared his
love to her as he would have declared it to an American
girl—that and nothing more. And she—what was she
thinking? What was going on inside that dainty, that
sad little head? He spoke of love in American; she
understood him in French. How was he to know that?</p>

<p class='c006'>They spoke hardly a word as the Metro carried them
to the Place St.-Michel, nor was the silence broken as
they walked slowly up the darkened Boulevard, so dark
that at times they had actually to feel their way through
a spot of blackness. There was an occasional dim blue
street light, but no lights were visible from any interior....
The shining out of the feeblest of lights would have
brought next day a summons to appear before the police
to explain the matter. Paris was severe in the matter
of lights. Kendall had seen the people stone an automobile
at night because the driver had neglected to dim
his lamps! The city had no humor in its appreciation of
air raids.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree did not make him turn back at the usual spot.
She seemed to have forgotten him, though she clung to
his arm, and they went on to broad rue Soufflot, which
leads off the Boulevard at right angles to the Panthéon.
In the middle of the first block Andree paused.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is necessary to go back now,” she said, turning her
face to him, and he bent over so that he might see its
expression.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why did you cry?” he asked</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I was afraid,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are not afraid now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I have said I shall not have fear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He took both her hands and drew her close to him.
There were none to see. The street was deserted. Even
the tables and chairs of the café at the corner were piled
in close to the wall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You love me a little?” he insisted.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a tiny pause. “Yes,” she said. It was a
queer, decided little syllable, uttered as after mature
deliberation. She was looking up into his face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne!</i>” he said, softly, and kissed her. This time
her lips were not cold, his caress was not tolerated, but
returned. She returned his kiss. It was not the first
girl Kendall had kissed, but it opened his eyes to the
possibilities of a kiss. It went to his head, and he snatched
her up in his arms as if she had been a baby. “You love
me?... You will always love me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, in that same voice of calm decision.
“And you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Always.... Always,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non....</i> I know. For a week, for a month....
That is all. You are not <i>fidèle</i>.... You will go away and
I shall be sad. I know, but I am lonely.” She kissed
him. “But we shall be glad,” she said, wistfully. “We
shall have happiness—many little minutes of happiness.
I shall pretend that you never go away to leave me
<i>solitaire</i>....”</p>

<p class='c006'>What could he say? He protested and asserted, but she
smiled a grave smile of knowledge and of resignation.
She knew what she knew. “To-morrow,” she said.
“Place de la Concorde. <i>Sept heures.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you love me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you not believe?” she asked, sweetly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well.... Good night, monsieur. To-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She kissed him again and freed herself. In another
moment her daintiness had been engulfed in the mysterious
blackness. Once more she had vanished into her fairy-land....
Each time he wondered if it could be possible
that there should be another visitation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall, young, inexperienced in serious thought as he
was, realized that some sort of crisis in his life had arrived;
events impended which were to modify him, which
were to affect him and to continue to affect him so long
as life should last. He did not know what. He did not
realize what had just happened to him and to Andree,
and yet he wondered ... wondered. And he loved her;
he was sure of it. Just as he was sure she was worthy of
his love!</p>

<p class='c006'>He was exalted, yet he was troubled, perplexed, worried,
so he walked. At the Boulevard St.-Germain he
turned off to the eastward, crossing the Seine upon the
Pont Sully, and swinging to the left on the Quai Henri IV
until he reached the Boulevard de la Bastille, and so to
the place forever marked in the annals of time as the spot,
not where the Bastille had stood, but as the spot where it
had been <i>destroyed</i>.... The great column uprose blackly
before him. At his left was a Metro station, its entrance
surrounded by people, who elbowed and surged, or stood or
sat wearily near to that place of subterranean refuge....
For so had the <i>Gothas</i> affected the imagination of the
poor of Paris! Their nights were nights of terror, for the
Hun in his malignant ingenuity sought to drop his bombs
in this quarter of Paris, near the Bastille, in the Faubourg
St.-Antoine—St.-Antoine, mother of revolutions! If these
people could be terrorized, they might be driven to a fresh
revolution, reasoned Berlin.... They were in terror,
but there was no fresh revolution.... And so they
cowered about the subway entrances, men, women, boys,
girls, wailing children in arms, ready to descend into
the cold dampness of the tube at the first note of the
<i>alerte</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the first time Kendall had seen this thing, and
it went to his heart. He felt an uprush of rage against
the Hun who wrought thus inhumanly, thus without that
sportsmanship which has lifted war from its mire of blood
and horror and degradation, to paint it with the glamour
of chivalry and heroism.... Chivalry was dead, slain
by the <i>boche</i>, who made frightful war upon defenseless
populations, stark naked, hideous, savage war stripped of
glamour and of glory. The Hun pictured war not as a
St. Michael clad in shining armor and mounted upon a
glorious charger, but as a skeleton from which the decaying
flesh had not completely fallen, riding upon a wolf....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall walked on, turning now toward home. He felt
that he could not sleep unless he walked himself to
exhaustion, so he continued on and on and on. His
consciousness was the ground of a battle between the
inheritances that came from his mother and those which
came from his gentle father—in which his own individual,
peculiar reason sought to intervene.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look out,” said his mother. “She’s French, and she
must be bad. She’s getting you into her clutches....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, now,” said his father, “she’s a sweet little
thing, perty as a picture. I don’t see how there can be
harm in her, and if there should be, it wouldn’t be wilful
harm.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’s nice,” said Kendall himself. “She’s a nice girl,
and nothing’s going to happen. Why—I tell you, she’s
a <i>nice</i> girl!”</p>

<p class='c006'>And so it went, suspicion, accusation, argument, defense,
until his brain whirled and he was miserable, but
always his intelligence, lighted by meager experience,
emerged triumphant with the declaration that she was
a nice girl, and no harm could come of it....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall forgot that he was a guest in a strange world;
that his mode of thought, his code of ethics, his purview
of life and of the affairs of life were foreign, were not of
the currency of this land. It was more than a mere difference
between races; it was a difference between those
elements which make <i>life</i>.... But one thing he was
given to see, and that was, that whatever came to Andree
and himself could not be evil, could not be mean or
squalid or wicked—and, in his limited vocabulary, it all
came back to the comforting assertion, “But she’s a
nice girl.” That persisted, no matter what other paths
of speculation his thoughts might follow. Andree was
good. There was something about her that proclaimed
that she would continue to be <i>good</i>, and it was comforting
to him.... And he believed he loved her....</p>

<p class='c006'>He went to bed and fell asleep with the remembrance
of Andree’s kiss upon his lips....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the morning Kendall was given orders to leave that
night for the headquarters of the Second Division,
which lay not distant from Meaux—that splendid body
of old Regulars and Marines who had but a few weeks
before proved the worth of the American soldier to the
Hun and to the Allied armies by its splendidly achieved
defense of the Paris-Metz highway—and there to gather
certain information on shoes and ships and sealing-wax
and cabbages and cooties and morale and crops and
transport. He was to acquire this information with all
possible despatch and accuracy, and to return to Paris
with his report. An army automobile, carrying certain
other officers, would leave 10 rue Ste.-Anne at nine
o’clock that evening.</p>

<p class='c006'>So he was going to the front. He was actually to
penetrate to those not distant battle-lines and to hear the
sound of guns and himself to come under hostile fire....
He was not, then, to rest safely in Paris for the duration
of the war; was not to return to America a veteran of
the roll-top desk and the ink-well! It was only for a
space of days, but he would actually have been there,
actually have set his feet in a trench—to be a part of a
combat division. He was delighted.... He hoped
something would happen, that his days at the front might
not be uneventful, that he might see and take part in
some manifestation of real war. His sentiments were
very boyish. Why, he might actually be wounded, and
so entitled to wear on his sleeve a golden wound chevron!
He found himself close to hoping it would be so, and, with
a sudden assertion of common sense, laughed at himself
when he discovered he was actually selecting the part of
his anatomy in which he preferred to receive his wound.
He had decided on a leg, the fleshy part of the leg. That
would not be serious, would not incapacitate him for
more than a few days or weeks. It was really a glowing
prospect.... And it would make him a veteran!</p>

<p class='c006'>However, going to the front that night was unhandy.
He had a <i>rendez-vous</i> with Andree and an appointment to
dine with Monsieur Robert.... But that would be
possible. Number 10 rue Ste.-Anne was just around the
corner from Marty’s. He could dine and then hasten
to be where his orders called him.... Andree was
eclipsed by the adventure.</p>

<p class='c006'>At noon he packed such things as were necessary and
whisked them by taxicab to rue Ste.-Anne where he left
them in charge of a sergeant in the Assistant Provost
Marshal’s office. This left him free until nine o’clock....
He was proud that his equipment contained a steel
helmet and gas-mask.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was an exultant and excited young man who waited
for Andree at the Metro station in the Place de la Concorde
that evening. He wanted to tell her. He wanted
to impress her with the fact that he was a real soldier and
was going into danger. He even rehearsed the nonchalant
speech which would announce it to her.... And
at last she appeared—again in white, again with that
quaint air of detachment and concentration, and still
very lovely in her fragile, slender way.... Suddenly
he was sorry he was going, because it meant an absence
from her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now she was recognizing him in that delightfully timid
way of hers—doubting her welcome until he reassured her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good evening, monsieur,” she said in French. She
was always formal in those first few moments.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve wanted to see you—wanted to see you ever since
you left me last night,” he said, rather unexpectedly to
himself, especially unexpected in its truth, for it was true,
though he realized it only then.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is well,” she said, and looked up at him quickly,
smilingly, with something shining in her eyes that had
never been there before. “And I have thought of you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It has been a long day.... All the days are long
because you are not with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is true?” She paused, demanding to be assured
that he was speaking in earnest, and he took her arm
and pressed it to his side. “That is nice,” she said.
“You should miss me at all times. Oh yes. Ver’, ver’
much.... And I shall also miss you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dear,” he said, bending close to her ear, “do you
love me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, simply.</p>

<p class='c006'>And then he knew that his great news had turned to
aloes in his mouth. The thing he had longed to tell her—a
little boastfully—he could not bear to tell her now,
and he wondered vaguely why it should be so. But he
must tell her. He started to do so, and stopped. No—it
would do as well after dinner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you?” she said, after a little pause.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very much.... Very much....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no.... I am afraid. It cannot be so. You
only say—that is all. You have make me love you—and
soon you will go away and leave me to cry.... Yes....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And if I do,” he said, striving to tease her, “you will
soon find another American. Sure you will.... <i>Vous
êtes très-méchante.... Pas fidèle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How can you say? It is not kind. Oh, I am <i>fidèle</i>.
You believe? Yes, yes. You believe?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course, child,” he said, repentantly. “I was only
joking.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you—are you <i>fidèle</i>? On the nights when I do
not meet with you—what then? Do you see some other
girl?... Men are not <i>fidèle</i>.... You see other girl—lots
of other girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now look here, you mustn’t say that. You’re the
only girl in the world I give a snap of my finger for....
Just you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well,” she said, contentedly; and then, “We
dine with thees yo’ng actor thees evening?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I am glad.... It is ver’ important. He must
like me, and then he will speak for me at the <i>Conservatoire</i>.
You must be ver’ good friend to him so that he will speak
for me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, young lady, you keep away from that young
actor. He’s too darned handsome. I don’t want him
stealing you away from me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non.... Non....</i> I do not care for him, only
that he speak for me. You must not be afraid.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shall we take a taxi?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. There is much time. A taxi is much expensive.
I must not make you spend all your money.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That wouldn’t be such a hard job. I haven’t much
to spend.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is no matter.... If you had much—that is different—then
I would spend.... It is not for money
that I know you—oh no. At first—then I do not know
what kind of yo’ng man you are.... I take you to
that expensive café. It is to punish you because you
speak to me as you did.... I did not know you. But
now I know you ver’ well. You have been kind.” She
nodded her head in punctuation. “You have been always
nice and ver’ gentle, and so I see you ver’ often.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nobody could help being gentle with you, <i>mignonne</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know,” she said. “The worl’ it is not nice.”
She shook her head disapprovingly. “All men are not
nice.... It is ver’ hard, and sometimes I am most
unhappy. It is so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you are happy now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She pointed her finger down at the sidewalk. “Now—thees
minute—yes. In one hour in four hours it may
not be so. Who can say?”</p>

<p class='c006'>It brought him again to his going away, and a real
dread of making the announcement to her seized upon
him. He was afraid she would cry or do some other
equally distressing thing. But that was selfish. He
dreaded her crying because it would be unpleasant for
himself and was rather ashamed of it. He even fancied
he could understand something of how she would actually
feel, but he was wrong. He was groping in the darkness,
wandering in the darkness of a strange mansion with
many rooms and devious passages, and it was inevitable
that he should miss his way....</p>

<p class='c006'>They entered Marty’s and Monsieur Robert came forward
to greet them with that delicious, boyish smile of his.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am glad you come,” he said, bobbing his head.
“My friends they shall be jealous to see me wit’ such
pretty girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree was very prim and quiet with that quaint
attractive quietness that always made Kendall wonder,
because he had never seen anything like it. It was a sort
of waiting quietness, a kind of recess that Andree retired
into to await events, and from which she would emerge
impish or girlish or serious, like a child or like a weary
woman. One felt she was not present bodily, but was
staring at one expectantly to read one’s mood, or, possibly,
to read one into the future and to foretell if good or
ill were to come out of it. Now she watched Monsieur
Robert when he was not looking at her, but the instant
his eyes turned toward her her own eyes would hide behind
their lashes diffidently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What shall we eat?” Monsieur Robert asked, in French.
“<i>Potage? Poulet rôti, cresson? Haricots verts? Salade?...</i>
Eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sounds good,” said Kendall, but monsieur was looking
expectantly to Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is well,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pommard?... The <i>vin ordinaire</i> is not for us
to-night?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was not interested in the wine, and Kendall trusted
to the young actor’s judgment. So they gave their order,
and were only commencing on the soup when a commotion
at the door apprised Kendall that Jacques was coming.
Andree had started at the noise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is Jacques,” he said to her. “I told you about him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, but did not turn her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a moment Jacques paused at the table and stared,
drew himself to his full height, threw back his hair from
his brow with a flamboyant gesture, and shouted:
“A-ah!... A-ah!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was embarrassed. There was no telling what
Jacques might say or do, for the man had a rather terrible,
if delicious, frankness, and discussed with openness
and noise what Kendall was accustomed to hear
spoken of in whispers by men alone—and by them in
corners.... He had heard Jacques one evening going
from table to table—demanding of friends and strangers
alike their judgment on a certain phase of the art of
making love. Kendall had really been shocked and had
looked for somebody to stand up and smite Jacques
mightily, but everybody had laughed and answered according
to their kind with a frankness equal to Jacques’s....
So now Kendall was apprehensive.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A-ah!...” said Jacques again, and pointed at
Andree. “I ask you if I should not find for you a girl,
and you say <i>no</i>. Now I know why.... A-ah!...”
He frowned at Andree and waggled his head. “She is
nice,” he said, approvingly. Then he appeared to notice
Monsieur Robert for the first time and glared at him,
glared and poked a long finger under his nose. “<i>He</i>
dines with you,” he said, tragically. “You—you make
introduce your girl to him.... <i>Oh, là là!</i> What is this?
Do you not know that this man steals little girls?...
He is ver’ bad. Look you out or he will steal her from
you. It is I, Jacques, your friend, who make the warning.”
Then suddenly he turned away and flew across
the room to kiss a young woman who had just entered
with the elderly critic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken was at a loss to know if the fellow had been in
earnest or were merely up to his usual capers....</p>

<p class='c006'>The three at the table chatted, Andree always maintaining
that queer reserve, not emerging from her hiding-place,
speaking only when directly addressed, and then
briefly. Monsieur Robert looked at her frequently, and
ever more frequently, for she was a charming picture, and
more than once spoke to her in French. She always
replied in English.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think mademoiselle look ver’ nice on the stage,” he
said to Ken. “If only she have the talent.” He shrugged
his shoulders. “Pretty eyes and talent for act not always
are together,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can’t tell till you try,” said Kendall, colloquially.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should like for hear mademoiselle recite one day.
Mademoiselle studies Racine?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Already I know many parts,” said Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is well. Some day you and Capitaine Ware
shall come and you shall recite for me, <i>n’est-ce pas</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Oui, monsieur</i>,” she said, primly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is but one way to enter into the stage,” he
continued. “It is the <i>Conservatoire</i>. Then, if one make
the success, there is the Comédie Française.... But it
is not easy to enter into the <i>Conservatoire</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mais non</i>.... It is ver’ difficult,” she said, despairingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah.... But if some one speak for you? Then it ees
not the same—it ees differen’.... But we shall see.
Capitaine Ware ees my frien’. I would oblige him.
Also I would oblige mademoiselle.” He looked at her
rather intently. “We shall see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The roast chicken arrived, surrounded by cress and
swimming in a delicious sauce. Conversation languished.
From time to time Kendall turned to look at Andree,
for it always delighted him to see her eat, she was so
intent about it. She went about it as if eating were an
intricate problem requiring concentration.... And presently
they fell to chatting in fragmentary fashion, Andree
translating for both Kendall and Monsieur Robert, and it
was very jolly and pleasant.... Kendall did not notice
how often the young actor glanced at Andree....</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently they were through and monsieur was compelled
to hurry away because he had a part in the piece
that was playing that evening. “I mus’ see you ver’
soon,” he said to them both, but with his eyes intently
upon Andree’s—which dropped before his gaze. “I mus’
hear mademoiselle recite.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll fix it up,” said Ken. “Good night.” They
shook hands and Monsieur Robert bent to kiss Andree’s
hand, bent gracefully, with a charming air that was half
joking, half serious. It set upon him well. “Good
night,” he said, and hastened toward the theater.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I like him,” said Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree looked at him quickly, her face expressionless.
“Yes?” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How can I say? I do not know him.... He is ver’
handsome.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It doesn’t matter whether you like him or not—so long
as he gets you into that <i>Conservatoire</i> thing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She did not reply.</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked the best part of a block before she spoke.
“It is ver’ <i>nécessaire</i> for me to enter into the Conservatoire....
Oh, ver’ <i>nécessaire</i>.... I mus’ earn money.
I have no money. I mus’ earn it for myself, because there
is no one to earn it for me.... You do not onderstan’....
Sometime, before the war, yo’ng girls say they do
not need to earn money, because they marry. All will be
wives and the husbands they will earn.... Now it ees
not so—<i>non</i>—it ees differen’.... You onderstan’?
Many, many yo’ng girl mus’ learn to earn money, and
because they will always be alone.... There can be no
one....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It does mean a lot to you, doesn’t it? I’ll be mighty
happy if I can help.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was silent again for a time and then said, suddenly,
as if thinking aloud, “I theenk I can enter into the
<i>Conservatoire</i> if I want to....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was not anything.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He scarcely heard her; his mind was not on what she
said, for he was thinking to himself, “I must tell her....
I must tell her now,” and was nerving himself up to make
the announcement of his departure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Andree,” he said, and stopped.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you love me?” he said, procrastinating. It was
not what he had intended to say.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.” She spoke very sweetly. “And you?” The
question sounded so charming from her lips, the tone and
the manner of it were rare and lovely; they seemed to
say, “I know you love me, but it is sweet—very sweet—to
hear you say so.” The street was dark and he drew
her close to him, and so they walked, his arm about her
waist, she responding to his touch so deliciously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I love you—I do love you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well.... I am ver’ happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, Andree—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I’ve got to go away.... Only for a day or two,”
he hastened to say. “It’s just a little trip.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now—to-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>To-night?</i>” Her tone was so strange, so startled, so
shocked. “<i>To-night?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Orders,” he said. “Nothing could take me away
from you but orders.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She had drawn away from him, and was striving to peer
into his face, but the darkness prevented. She was
striving to read from his eyes if he were telling the truth.
She had feared his going—this young man from strange
America. The possibility of his going had become a
nightmare to her—always present in the profound recesses
of her thoughts.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To the front.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“O-oh!...” It was not an exclamation, it was a
suppressed cry. It was one of the things she had feared,
that this young soldier would be sent from her to the
hell of battle, and that he would not return, as the brothers
and the husbands and the sweethearts of her acquaintances
had gone—to be swallowed up and to be seen no more
on earth.... He was going.... The thing was going
to happen to her.... Her man—the man she loved—was
going to become a sacrifice as those millions of other
men had become sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had feared that she would cry, that she would
cling to him with sobs and beg him not to go, that she
might make some sort of regrettable scene, but she did
not. But she was very still with the stillness of the
stricken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>C’est la guerre</i>,” she said in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is the war—that phrase so often heard, which excuses
everything, accounts for everything. But now it had a
deeper meaning. <i>This</i> was the war! This parting was
the war—this giving of a loved one to death, and this
remaining behind in an agony of fear and of loneliness—this
was indeed the war!... To men war is one thing—it
is a grim fight, it is suffering and wounds, it is bravery
and glory.... To man war, at its most, can mean
only death. But to a woman who sends her man it
means more, infinitely, terribly more. It means that she
may be deprived of all that makes life desirable. It
means that she must remain behind to fear and to suffer,
and then, when the feared news arrives, to face a life that
is not life, a life without love, without companionship.... A
life with the smile snatched away and with the
heart robbed of laughter! It means that from her the
one, the great, the vital thing is to be forever missing, and
that the future is to be nothing but day following day.... War
means that men must die.... War means
that women must continue to live!</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mustn’t worry.... I—I sha’n’t be in the fighting.
I’m just going to get certain information.” He
had looked forward to boasting to her about how he
would stand under fire. He would have done it in such
a way that it would not have sounded like boasting, but
in a mock-modest way. He had wanted to show her
that he was actually going into it to take his chance with
the rest.... Now he had no thought but to reassure
her; he had no desire to take unto himself the heroic.
“I promise you to come back,” he said. “I sha’n’t be
hurt.... It is only a day or two, and you mustn’t be
afraid.... Why”—here he lied—“I may not even be
near to danger.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She shook her head. “I know,” she said. And then:
“I shall not let you be hurt.... I shall prevent it.”
Like a little Spartan, she was herself again, speaking like
her own self, almost gaily. “Do you theenk I should
let you be hurt?... Oh no! Not in the least.” She
was being brave and calm—for him!</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will be back surely in four days—the fourth day
from to-day.... Then I shall see you. We will make
the engagement now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall dine with Arlette,” she said, with a little laugh.
“I will come there—it is easier—<i>sept heures</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, quietly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—by gad!—I <i>do</i> love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She touched his cheek gently with her finger. “And
there will be many <i>petites minutes</i>,” she said. “We shall
have much happiness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you will be <i>fidèle</i>—when you go away from me?
You will not find a yo’ng girl at the front—in the trenches?
Promise me?” She was laughing gaily now.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If I find a girl in the trenches,” he said, “I will give
her to the <i>boche</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well,” she said, and clapped her hands merrily.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were close to the Metro station at the Palais
Royal now, and, for their parting, paused in the blackness
of a recess.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t go home with you—do you mind?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ver’ much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-by, <i>mignonne</i>....”</p>

<p class='c006'>For a moment she clung to him, the fear that was
upon her manifest in the trembling of her little body.
“Not good-by,” she said. “We must not say good-by.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Four days from to-day—without fail.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall not fail—I shall come, <i>certainement</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Again their lips met. “Now you must go,” he said,
and she turned away slowly and walked in that dainty
way of hers toward the entrance to the Metro. He stood
watching her, expecting her to turn back, but she did not
turn back.... In a moment she disappeared down the
stairs. He was miserable....</p>

<p class='c006'>But he did not understand—or if he did understand he
hid the truth from himself—what this parting on this
evening was to Andree.... Last night she had confessed
that she loved him, and had made him a promise,
a promise that he half understood, but which he pretended
to himself he did not understand at all....
Perhaps he did not really grasp the extent of her surrender,
for young men, American young men of such
upbringing as his, and such code of ethics as he knew,
are not equipped to understand—and sometimes nature
has made them very dull.... He had drifted along with
Andree until he was beyond his depth. To drift had
been so easy, for his heart had told him Andree was good—was
<i>nice</i>.... Now he hid from himself that he was
apprehensive of what might come, just as he tried to
hide from himself that his own viewpoint was changed,
and that a thing which had seemed very wrong and
squalid and unthinkable was not, perhaps, so evil as his
mother might assert.</p>

<p class='c006'>At any rate, he had arrived at this point—he would not
draw back. Andree was good, and he loved and respected
Andree. And ... it was very confusing ... he was
young and decent and as clean of mind as a man may be....
But—he was seeing and learning. Plymouth Rock
could not legislate for the world nor impose its prudery
and falsity—a prudery and falsity that made it a punishable
offense for a husband to kiss his wife on the Sabbath
day—upon an older world well able to legislate for itself.
America was America. Well and good! Let America
live according to the code it had chosen.... France was
France. Who, save only Deity Itself, could assert that
France was less virtuous, less in accord with the wishes
of the Supreme Composer of Ethical Systems, because the
ethics of France were not the ethics of Plymouth, Massachusetts,
or of Detroit, Michigan?</p>

<p class='c006'>But Kendall did not realize—how could he realize it?—that
to Andree, after her promise of the night before,
this parting had been in all its essentials as if she had been
deserted upon her bridal night....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was nearly eleven o’clock when Kendall and his
companions arrived in the old cathedral town of
Meaux and found accommodations in the Hôtel Sirène,
that rather quaint and down-at-heel hostelry which hides
in a courtyard behind huge gates that close at an hour so
early as to astonish Americans. Kendall was to discover
that this was the universal custom in the smaller towns
of the country—that the hotels closed themselves to
guests in the early evening, and that to effect an entrance
thereafter was an achievement.</p>

<p class='c006'>They contrived, however, to find huddled accommodations,
but Kendall did not find sleep for a long hour.
Events were imminent, events both of the soul and
material, and his imagination insisted upon handling them
and scrutinizing them. Speculations upon the proximity
of war mingled with anticipations and apprehensions of
his relations with Andree.... He fancied she, too, was
suffering a wakeful night....</p>

<p class='c006'>In the morning he awoke and breakfasted in a dining-room
filled with American newspaper correspondents, for
Meaux was at that date one of their headquarters, with
French and American officers and a few English Red
Cross nurses.... Presently he was in his car again and
moving through the narrow, crowded streets toward
Montreuil. The open country, rolling, beautiful, rich, lay
before him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here, indeed, were indications of war. The roads were
crowded with the traffic of warfare, with vehicles of all
sorts and descriptions moving toward the front or returning
from the front. The greater part of them were huge
French camions driven by <i>poilus</i> who looked out upon the
world with eyes that had seen such sights as alter the
fabric of a man’s soul during the four years that were
drawing to a close. They were all in haste. American
camions and camionettes and side-cars were rumbling or
whizzing by. Refugees driving cows, urging on weary
horses that dragged enormous two-wheeled carts heaped
high with household treasures, appeared now and then....
These seemed to Kendall to savor more of the
thing that was war than even such jolting, bumping
pieces of artillery as he encountered now and then....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was within hearing of the big guns on the battle-line,
yet all about him, spread in peaceful beauty, was a
country apparently secure, apparently untouched by the
devastation of an invading army. Yet, a few weeks
before, German cavalry patrols had penetrated almost to
this point. The fields were green and beautiful, promising
abundant crops. Children were entering a little school-house
just as children enter school-houses in America.
Farmers were working in their fields.... If it had not
been for the mass of military vehicles upon the roads
and for an occasional distant rumble that might have
been thunder, but was not the thunder of heaven, Kendall
could not have sensed the proximity of war.</p>

<p class='c006'>French soldiers on bicycles were frequent. Now a
Frenchman on a bicycle is one of the sights of the war.
Somehow he never seems to master the contrivance in
all its intricacies. He can ride furiously in a straight
line, coattails standing out straight behind, eyes fixed and
determined, jaws set. So long as he follows a bee-line
all is well, but you can read on his face that he realizes
the uncertainty of life. Let him be compelled to swerve
from his course, to turn a corner, or even to stop the
machine to alight, and there is none so rash as to prophesy
what will be forthcoming. Kendall saw one stocky poilu
attempt to turn around. It was amazing! The man
ricochetted off a camion against a stone pile, off the
stone pile into a donkey-cart, off the donkey-cart into the
arms of a troop of his marching comrades, scattering them
like chickens, thence through the <i>poilus</i> in zigzag to a
ditch, from which he presently rebounded, facing in the
direction in which he had originally traveled. He did not
turn. He had had enough of turning. Now he would
keep on his way without meddling with Providence,
doubtless intending to reach his destination by circumnavigating
the globe....</p>

<p class='c006'>Now Ken was passing long mule-teams driven by
American boys whose faces were so incrusted in dust as
to give them the appearance of figures carved out of
ghastly rock. Ken could see the dust in drifts on their
eyebrows, and their eyelashes had a strange albino-look.
Again his car edged over to give space to a truck carrying
to the rear the remnants of a destroyed German avion.
This moved by to disclose a long column of Italian troops,
armed not with rifles, but with picks and shovels—each
man wearing on his cap a vivid red star. Not a hundred
yards beyond was visible the gray rump of an observation
balloon, kneeling on the ground in the midst of a cluster
of trees like some unbelievably monstrous elephant, its
back incrusted with something that might have been
the green moss of great age. This was the camouflage
to make it indistinguishable from the foliage of the trees....
Presently Kendall was passing groups of hangars,
aeroplanes standing before them in the fields. Now it
was a huge howitzer grunting and straining to be at its
business farther ahead and lumberingly eager to join its
voice with the roars of its companions. Once in a while
by the roadside nestled a little plot of graves above which
waved the tricolor of France....</p>

<p class='c006'>An hour’s drive brought them to Montreuil and Kendall’s
car descended the steep and crooked road that led
into the valley where the tiny village, teeming with
American soldiers, lay in all its morning charm.... It
was not quiet. There sounded, every minute or so, the
sharp crack of the marvelous little seventy-five sending
its word of defiance to the German army which crouched
behind the hills, making ready for another leap at the
throat of France.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no stopping here. On they went along roads
whose wooded sides concealed American artillerymen and
artillery. Here was the edge of the front. Guns were
actually firing over Kendall’s head at the distant and
invisible enemy. He thrilled to this realization.... In
a few moments they passed on their left a beautiful château,
historic because it had been occupied by von Kluck
as headquarters when his armies were rushing onward to
meet their defeat at the Marne. The car passed through
Bezu, where was an American field hospital occupying a
tiny church, its operating-room now in the adjoining
building, which had been, a few weeks before, the school
crowded with urchins.... But there was neither priest
nor school-boy now. All were gone; all had fled before
the Hun and were scattered, God knew where, over the
face of France.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now Kendall’s driver turned off the main road and
shortly another hamlet lay before them—the remnants of
the place that had been Domptin. Here a military policeman
halted them, demanded credentials and destination.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You walk from here,” he said. “No cars pass over
this road by day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know the way?” Ken asked his driver.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So they alighted and trudged along the road. Ken
observed many little craters by the roadside and in the
fields, and, without asking, knew they had been caused
by hostile shells.... It was very noisy—or so Kendall
fancied. Artillery was at work on all sides of him, but
it was only the desultory fire of the quiet day. Though
the voices of the guns were audible, neither guns nor the
men who served them were to be seen. Kendall’s pulse
increased; he felt in the pit of his stomach that electric
sensation which always came to him while he stood
waiting for the referee’s whistle at the start of a football
game.</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked on. Even here, where the affairs of war
were unmistakable, there was that exotic sense of peace.
The woods were still green, the bushes thick and covered
with foliage, the crops, almost ready for the reaper,
waving and undulating as the breezes crossed the fields....
No human being was visible. Yet here ahead, to
the right and to the left, was the locale of one of the most
savage struggles of the war; here it was that the American
Second Division was thrown into the line to stop the
German as he marched, victory-flushed, upon Paris....
And here the German had stopped.... Just beyond
were fields of wheat and woodlands tenanted by no living
being, but nevertheless tenanted. In their depths, concealed
from the eye, not reachable by any human hand,
were the unburied bodies of American dead....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here we are,” said Kendall’s driver, pointing to a gray
rectangular mass of buildings just ahead. “Paris Farms.
Regimental headquarters of the Ninth Infantry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They entered the gates, passed the saluting sentry, and
found themselves in a square courtyard surrounded by
barns and farm buildings, with the old farm-house at the
opposite end. Groups of men in khaki sat close to the
walls. None were in the middle of the courtyard, and
Kendall’s driver, instead of leading him up the path
that ran directly to the door, conducted him in a round-about
way, his shoulder rubbing the wall.... In the
air above was the intermittent throb of a German aeroplane
reconnoitering, and it was the duty as well as the
desire of all men to remain invisible....</p>

<p class='c006'>Life, for the most part, is made up of small matters, of
small joys and small griefs, of little pleasurable surprises
and minor catastrophes. In the ratio as the little joys
outnumber the little sorrows we are happy. Tremendous
events, crashing climaxes, occur in few lives. But we
like to fancy ourselves participants in astonishing doings,
and as the victims of beneficiaries of amazing coincidences.
We are so constituted that we can be amazed at the
slightest deviation from the normal, and the arrival of a
genuine surprise can set us all by the ears with excitement....
A benevolent surprise awaited Kendall inside the
door of the ancient farm-house. It was of not the least
importance in the scheme of the universe and would not
modify Kendall’s life by the breadth of a hair, yet it was
potent to overshadow everything else in his mind for
hours and to make him feel that he had been singled out
by the powers for especial grace.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a broad hallway, cluttered with bedding rolls
and occupied by a group of lounging soldiers. At the
right was a room occupied as the office of the adjutant,
which Kendall entered a trifle diffidently as a stranger,
wondering what manner of men he would be required to
have dealings with.... And then....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ken Ware!” shouted a voice, and a young second
lieutenant with the most pitiable of mustaches—a yellow
and yearning mustache—leaped from a desk at his right
to greet him. “Where did you rain down from, and
where did you get all those bars on your shoulders?”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Jimmy Martin, whom Kendall had last known
as a newspaper man in Detroit, with whom he had been
familiar in those affairs of young manhood which make
for friendships to be looked back upon with longing
and regret when the days and the affairs of young manhood
have been engulfed in the past.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are you doing? What are you doing <i>here</i>?”
Jimmy demanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m in the Intelligence. And you—?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Intelligence officer of this regiment.... And only a
second lieutenant. Ought to be a captain. Doing a
captain’s work. Say”—he was a sudden young man—“wait
till I get my tin lid and cane and we’ll go to see the
sights. How long are you here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bring on your sights,” said Kendall. “While you are
exhibiting I can get from you what I came for.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wish you could stay. We’ve got a darn good mess.
Not as good as we had the first few days, but good.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why the first few days?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We went out and gathered up stuff to eat—to save it
from the <i>boche</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Foraging, eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not exactly. We gathered it in and ate it to prevent
its giving aid and comfort to the enemy. One day we
got a pig at eleven-thirty and had chops for lunch at one.
The colonel said that pork was too close to being pig for
him. Next day we had rabbits. Speared them with
pitchforks. There was a bully strawberry-patch up the line
and we had plenty until a regiment of Senegalese moved
in and looted it. There’s a patch of gooseberries in
No Man’s Land, and we have the devil’s own time keeping
the men from going out after them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As they passed out and through the barn into the woods
Kendall explained his errand, and the conversation became
technical. Whatever else he might have been,
Jimmy Martin was engrossed in his particular job and,
apparently, was admirably efficient. The greater part
of the data Kendall wanted was at Jimmy’s tongue’s end;
the rest would be readily obtainable from available
records of Martin’s work.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this time they had traversed a plainly marked road
which led along the end of a field bordering the woods,
and Jimmy complained bitterly of its evidence. “We’ve
made that road since we came here. It’ll show up
plain on their photographs and show a lot of circulation
here.... You can see they’ve been droppin’ shells on
it now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They entered the denseness of the woods to find it
teeming with American soldiery who occupied the quiet
of the day in enlarging and making more comfortable
the makeshift dugouts they inhabited.... These were
not such dugouts as Kendall had seen described in books
about the war; they were such affairs as he had made
himself when he was a boy and called “coojees,” where
he had played robber and baked potatoes. They were
hastily dug and as hastily covered with a mat of boughs
and a layer of earth—flimsy sanctuaries, able to shelter
from spraying shrapnel, but of no effect whatever against
explosive shell.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly an invisible seventy-five was discharged
almost at Kendall’s elbow, and Jimmy laughed to see his
friend’s reaction to the unexpected sound. They parted
the bushes and examined the beautiful little gun—that
weapon which one may almost say has been the salvation
of France!</p>

<p class='c006'>A captain of artillery issued belligerently from a timbered
dugout and confronted Martin. “Say,” he demanded,
“you’re the ding-donged Intelligence officer that
had me pinched the other night. Ain’t you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, was it you? Sorry. The boys are sort of stirred
up about spies. They didn’t savvy you. When a
strange officer comes poking around these woods looking
for a place to light and asking oodles of questions about
whether there’s artillery here and such like, somethin’s
goin’ to happen. A couple of boys came rushin’ up to
me to ask what to do, and I told them to pinch you.
This place is full of spy rumors. Everybody’s seein’ them.
The doughboy that hasn’t seen somethin’ darn mysterious
and suspicious in the last twenty-four hours is
hard to find.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Forget it. I was some lost. Should have reported
before I came down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where was it they got Lieutenant Small last night?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Down this path about a hundred yards. His horse
is there yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall and Martin walked that way. Under a shelter
of boughs stood the handsome horse of which the dead
lieutenant had been so fond; he stood quietly switching
his tail and nibbling the leaves about him, all unconscious
that his back would never again bear the weight of a
gentle master.... And thirty feet away was the spot
where Small had met his death, met it because he had
scorned the shelter of a dugout, but with his French
orderly had slept on the surface of the earth, with no
shelter except a lean-to of brushwood.... On the surrounding
bushes were gruesome shreds....</p>

<p class='c006'>So this was war at last! On this spot a man had been
killed by the enemy and the blood of him was not yet
dry!... Somehow it convinced Kendall that he was at
the front, that there was actual danger where he stood.
He was experiencing the thing he had come to France
hoping to experience.... And yet it was difficult to
feel the fact. He had fancied the line of battle to be a
constant tumult, horrible with tremendous showers of
bursting shells and glorious with charges and defenses.
In its stark actuality it was quite different. Affairs were
gone about nonchalantly and methodically. Even the
artillerymen who sent a shell now and then at some target
they could not see served their guns in a bored manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was only by a certain tingling of the nerves that he,
a tenderfoot in this business, sensed the presence of war;
that war was here about him, within reach of his arm.
Those seventy-fives which spoke with such a vicious,
through-the-teeth bark were sending lethal shells across
the sunlit landscape, causing death and wounds. Possibly
that very shell which he could hear as it sped on its
way might kill an enemy.... And these boys killed
with an air of detachment and <i>ennui</i>....</p>

<p class='c006'>And the infantrymen! Scattered through the woods
about their rabbit-warren of dugouts, they looked and
acted like boys on holiday, on some camping excursion.
They chatted and frolicked, and grumbled about the food,
and because they were not relieved and sent to rest
billets, and because the enemy did not try to advance,
and because they themselves were not sent against the
enemy. Kendall absorbed a feeling that they rather
liked the whole thing, that it was just the life they
were born to and were fitted to live—and that they
knew it.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a picture, there in the <i>bois</i>, a picture that touched
the imagination of that young man from the peaceful
Middle West and would not soon be erased from his
memory. The trees grew closely, admitting only patches
of sunlight here and there, with an effect of peaceful,
lazy, restful shade. One saw dimly. The scene was
soothing to the eyes, alive as it was with movement.
The brown of uniforms blended with the yellow-green
of the foliage and with the red-yellow of the upturned soil
where it had been broken by hundreds of shovels in the
fashioning of shelters.... Kendall stood and watched
and knew that he was beholding a sight which, in the
years of his age, he would see again and describe again,
and live again in the telling.... It excited him, yet he
wondered why it should excite him more than it had done
when he had seen other khaki-clad boys in camps in
America.... It was because these boys slept with
death for a blanket-mate. It was because no man of
them knew what minute might call him with awful suddenness
over the threshold of life and into the mysteries
of death....</p>

<p class='c006'>There had been no fire from the enemy. Since the
dawn their guns had been silent, but now, without warning,
the air was filled with a threat, with a sound which
Kendall had never heard before, but which he recognized
by the instinct of self-preservation which resided in him.
It was the rushing, shrieking, rending, express-train rush
of a big shell—not of a shell going, but of one coming.
It startled Kendall. For an instant he was blind and
deaf to everything in the universe but the approach
of that shell, and it seemed to him to be directing itself
exactly at the small of his back. He wanted to dodge,
to run, to obliterate himself from that portion of the
earth, but there was no place to betake himself. It was
a matter of seconds, of parts of a second. The shell
screeched over their heads and detonated over toward
the farm-house.... And Ken became fully conscious
again, a bit surprised that he was still in the same spot
and that he had not made himself ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now pictures came to him that he had seen in that
interval, pictures seen but registering now for the first
time. He laughed.... The woods had resolved itself
into a prairie-dog village at the first instant of alarm.
The air had been full of diving legs as soldiers plunged
headlong into the earth. Everywhere Ken’s eyes had
looked they had seen an American soldier disappearing
with comical haste into the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was about time for them to start,” said Martin.
“We’d better get back to headquarters. I may be
wanted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked back hurriedly while shell after shell
screamed down at them as it rushed over their heads.
Ken was silent. He was thinking: “I’m under fire.
I’m really under fire. The enemy is shooting at <i>me</i>....
They are trying to kill <i>me</i>.” It was not easy to convince
his mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>As they entered the farm-house the shells were coming
in rapid succession and exploding in the vicinity with
tremendous detonations. Young Martin cocked his ear
and hazarded an opinion as to their caliber.... A
jagged fragment, hurtled from an explosion a hundred
feet away, crashed through the roof and came to rest on
the second floor. Young Martin was delighted; he
rushed up-stairs after the bit, carrying it down gingerly
wrapped in a cloth, for it was still hot, and then with joy
applied gauges and calipers to it so that he might identify
it exactly.... He was happy. The gauge was as he
had named it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say,” he said over his shoulder to several officers who
were gathered in the room, “listen here: now comes this
man with orders for us to report on the crops of the
neighborhood. Kind of crops. Quantity. Quality. How
many kernels of wheat to the head.... My business is
collecting information about the Germans....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Huh!” grunted the lieutenant-colonel, who evidently
in civilian life had been acquainted with market reports,
“snails weak to medium. Frogs strong. Give it to ’em,
boy. Full particulars.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say, colonel, you know that woods we were talking
about.” Martin pointed to a map on the wall. “The
boches are using it. My men have reported circulation
there, and they’ve been putting up camouflage. How
many shells will it take to gas ’em out? I’d like to get
’em out of there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have to have brigade orders to use gas....”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Blammm!</i> came a detonation unpleasantly near, but
still beyond the headquarters. The colonel cocked his
ear. “Boy, don’t you make them no shorter,” he drawled.</p>

<p class='c006'>The adjutant entered. “General’s here. Come to
mess. He and the colonel are coming down-stairs now.
All in.”</p>

<p class='c006'>All filed into the mess-room. The younger officers had
been full of boyish spirits and pranks, but decorum settled
on them as they entered the door. They seemed suddenly
to grow up and to acquire the demeanor of maturity, and
stood erect in stately manner while Kendall was presented
to the general and the colonel.... And then
the meal proceeded. Kendall wondered where the food
came from, but asked no embarrassing questions about
the source of supplies. There was chicken, there were
potatoes, there was fresh asparagus, there was custard
pudding, there were cheese and coffee and cherries—and
then cigars.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t get the idea we pass cigars at every mess,”
whispered a daring lieutenant in Kendall’s ear. “Just
throwin’ ourselves in honor of the general....”</p>

<p class='c006'>The bombardment had increased in violence during the
meal, had increased to such a degree that Kendall thought
rather more of falling shells than of food.... There was
absolutely no protection. A shell might crash down upon
them through the frail structure at will.... But nobody
appeared to mind. Kendall reflected that he, perhaps,
did not appear to mind, and wondered if the others were
experiencing the same sensations as he. He did not see
how it could be otherwise. Or had they found some
magic philosophy which rendered them immune to reflections
upon sudden death?... The general told the
colonel a humorous anecdote, and the colonel replied
to it with another equally pointless to Kendall’s way of
thinking. Why in thunder, he wondered, didn’t they
get through with this meal and go to a place a bit more
sheltered?... But the seniors chatted on, apparently
with placid enjoyment of Philippine and Cuban reminiscences,
all to the accompaniment of bursting high-explosive
shells, one of which could have obliterated that
farm-house and all the men it contained.</p>

<p class='c006'>But an end arrived. The general and the colonel arose,
and it became etiquette for the juniors to arise as well.
The dignitaries disappeared to the colonel’s quarters up
the stairs, and a few of the younger officers went to the
adjutant’s office across the hall, Kendall and Jimmy with
them. The telephone on Martin’s desk buzzed and
Jimmy lifted the receiver. He looked up with a frown.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This nut down the road wants to know if the general’s
killed yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did he say <i>general</i> over that ’phone?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then we can sit down and expect to get really shelled
now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was then that Kendall learned that the general
theory was that the enemy had found means to tap all
our telephone wires and to listen in to our conversations—a
theory which has given rise to much quaint telephone
conversation, couched in a language not hitherto known
on this or any other planet.</p>

<p class='c006'>Darkness was falling without, and with the darkness
came a multiplication of the shells designed by the enemy
for the discomfort of the regiment.... Kendall, to his
surprise, was growing accustomed to the shells. He was
conscious of them, but had lost something of his consciousness
of the danger that was in them.... He was
interested. It was an interesting spot and an interesting
moment, and he sat quiet and wide of eye to miss no
thrill that might be there for him.... Telephones were
busy with messages coming and going, messages camouflaged
by strange words and code numbers and weird
names. When plain English was necessary the longest
and most erudite words in the dictionary were sought,
doubtless on the theory that the German was not educated
to the point of comprehending them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Everybody had his job, and everybody seemed to believe
his especial piece of work to be the most important
in the army. A lieutenant came in with a scowl of
tremendous ferocity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Colonel,” he said, “we’ve got a damn bad situation.
It’s that doctor. He refuses to give some of my wounded
men wound chevrons. Says they aren’t wounded enough....
How bad has a man got to be shot before he’s wounded,
anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My understanding,” said the lieutenant-colonel, “is
that any man who is hurt enough to require medical attention
is entitled to a chevron.... It doesn’t make any difference
if he’s hurt by high explosive or hooked by a bull.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The din was now terrific. French and American
artillery had opened fire all along the line. So quickly
did report follow explosion and explosion report that the
whole mingled into one continuous and mighty sound.
And during it all the young Intelligence officer quarreled
with a sergeant who was his draftsman, as they tried
to reconcile maps drawn from observers’ sketches with
photographs taken from aeroplanes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Aw, hell!” growled the draftsman, “this guy’s
made a conventionalized design. What we’re lookin’ for
is what’s on the ground, not some guy’s pretty ideas.
You want me to make a map to send up to the general,
and what the devil have I got to make it from? I’m S.O.L....
There hain’t no damn woods like that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here,” declared Jimmy, indicating on maps and
photographs, “this woods is supposed to be that woods,
and this trench is supposed to be that trench.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Supposed!</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Expect me to send a map to the general and label it
‘Supposed?...’ That map’s pretty, all right, but it
hain’t worth a hoot in Hoboken. Call him up and ask
him what the blazes—”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall laughed, and was surprised to discover that he
could laugh, that anything would seem humor in this
place with death showering down on all sides.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the attentions of the enemy seemed to take on the
aspect of a serious effort, for the officers of experience
began to gather and to hold consultations and to listen
with marked interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gas!” somebody said. “Listen! Hear it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall listened, but could not distinguish the bursting
of the gas-shell, so easily to be identified by the practised
ear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gas-masks at <i>alerte</i>,” was the order.</p>

<p class='c006'>The telephone rang. “Shrapnel and gas here,” said an
observer some place out in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Got your mask on?” demanded Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. It ain’t bad yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You get that mask on and keep it on. Now. While
I’m waiting.... Is it on? ... There. You can telephone
as well through a mask as without it. Try it....
All right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a moment of comparative inactivity, then
the telephone again. “Mustard gas to the right,” was
reported, and after a few moments a call from a certain
company of infantry which had become unhappy in its
position: “Say, we want a retaliatory barrage. We’re
getting everything here—big, little, and gas.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They want a barrage,” reported Jimmy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where do they want it?” asked the lieutenant-colonel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know. Wake George up; that’s <i>his</i> business....
Say, let’s notify the gas officer; we’re beginning to
get it pretty close here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Jimmy called the person designated as George. “Hey!”
he said, irreverently. “Get your pants on and come down.
The adjutant wants you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was very chilly. Ken shivered with the cold, and
was rather thankful it was cold, because it gave him
honest reason for shivering. He was keyed to a high
pitch, nerves taut, imagination straining its leash, but
he was enjoying himself after a strange fashion, reveling
in this experience, in the sensations of peril, in the fact
that he was at the very center of things. The artillery
activity continued to increase, and the ear-shattering,
sweeping, rolling gusts of infernal clamor seemed to reach
a very climax of sound.... Again and again he could
feel upon his own body the shock of adjacent explosions.
It required but a few feet difference in the fall of one of
those shells to mean all that stood between life and death
for him.... And yet he was not afraid. He was not
conscious of fear, only of that queer electric sensation,
and of an elevation of spirits due to intense excitement.</p>

<p class='c006'>The telephone insisted with a new insistence each
moment. “Gas reported to the right.... Gas reported
to the left....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What shall we do about it?” Jimmy asked the
lieutenant-colonel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How about a little interdiction?” They spoke
casually, as one would say, “The road is dusty,” and the
other reply, “It might be well to sprinkle it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’ll be all right if we can get enough.... I’ll call
up and ask for it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then: “Hello!... Hello! Is this Hoboken?...
They’re giving us more gas than we like ... at right
and left and in front.... Yes.... Been coming twenty
minutes.... Is it worth while to retaliate?... Orders
to use gas have to come from you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’re in for <i>beaucoup</i> casualties,” somebody said out
of a moment’s pause.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say, you were too mild with Hoboken. I’d ’a’ told
him we was gettin’ gas to beat the devil, and we had to
have some doin’s of our own. Them birds don’t worry
about what <i>we’re</i> gettin’ unless we holler loud.” This
from the draftsman-sergeant.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There!” The adjutant looked up at the ceiling.
“Listen!... <i>Boche</i> aeroplane. I’ve heard it quite a
spell. Directing their fire by the flash of our batteries....
Gawd! Why don’t we get more aeroplanes of our
own!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The telephone again, and Jimmy reported with what
Kendall conceived to be relief, “He says he’ll have the
hundred and fifty-fives and gas going in ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say,” somebody complained, “that <i>boche</i> aeroplane
must be mired in a cloud. It sounds like it was standing
still in one spot.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stuck or not, she’s up there without any friendly
intentions.... Say, we ought to go over to the States
and shoot them peace-talkin’ pups.” It was the sergeant
speaking again. “Anybody that wants to make peace
with the <i>boche</i>!... They hain’t got no right pollutin’
the atmosphere....”</p>

<p class='c006'>There came a pause while all waited hopefully for the
“big stuff” that had been promised them—and presently
it came. Kendall had believed the ultimate in sound
had been achieved before, but this—this was impossible.
Such an extreme from silence could not be. It was
cosmic. It was awful. He seemed to be standing in the
very center of such an upheaval as might have created
worlds.... It upreared to a very ultimate climax of
sound, to a single note made up of a multitude of gigantic
sub-tones. It was amazing, it was terrifying, it was
gratifying....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fritz is gettin’ his good,” said the sergeant, with
profound satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>This continued an hour, and then gradually subsided.
The German fire had become desultory—and then ceased.
They had drawn upon themselves more than they liked
by their evening’s strafing.... The silence that ensued
was startlingly loud. One could hear it....</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m for some grub if we can rustle it,” said a raw-boned
lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lieutenant-colonel yawned and stretched his arms
high over his head. “Oh-hum!... Darn these quiet
nights,” he said, with sincerity. “I thought for a while
there was going to be something stirring.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I’m willing to have a rest once in a while,” said
Jimmy. “I’m going to sleep. Gimme all these quiet
nights you want to....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall looked at his watch. It was half past two in
the morning.... Quiet nights! He wondered if they
were making game of him, but as he looked back on the
conduct of these young men during that night he was
persuaded of their sincerity.... And he—he had fancied
himself present at the unloosing of Inferno....</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently he was lying on a bundle of hay on a stone
floor, wrapped in his blankets.... A sentence, a scrap
from the talk of the night, repeated itself to him, “We’re
in for casualties.” He pondered it. Casualties—that
meant wounded and dead; men mangled and men in the
horrible agonies that follow the breathing of mustard gas....
Some of those boys he had seen a few hours ago down
in the woods—only a few hundred feet away—were
dead ... <i>dead</i>! He had been near to death—had sat for
hours where death might reach out and touch him upon
the shoulder.... So this was war ... this was how the
thing was done!</p>

<p class='c006'>It seemed so futile. What had been accomplished by
this night’s slaughter? Neither side had advanced a
foot; nothing had been won or lost.... But hundreds of
lives had been wasted, hundreds of thousands of dollars’
worth of munitions had been expended—and why? For
nothing that he could see, for no purpose except the desire
of each side to make the other side uncomfortable....
That night could have been erased from the history of the
war, and its absence would never have been noticed.
Its activities had no more effect upon the course of the
war than the barking of a dog would have had—and
yet hundreds of bodies were tenantless, and hundreds of
mothers would mourn their sons.</p>

<p class='c006'>“War is scientific waste,” he said to himself, and repeated
the phrase. He hated war because it was waste....
He wondered how many men had given their lives
on just such futile nights as this during the years since
August, 1914. Thousands upon thousands, doubtless....
How many of those girls he had seen in Paris had
been deprived of husbands—of the men who would some
day have been their husbands—in just such affairs? It
was wrong—<i>wrong</i>.... War was a horrid disease, or
was it the German nation which was a horrid disease?
He could not think clearly.... He had thought little
of mankind in the mass, but now he considered it, and his
sympathy attached to it. It was futile to pity an individual,
any individual, but one’s heart might bleed for
mankind.... And most of all it might bleed for that
portion of mankind whose duty it is to be the mothers
of forthcoming generations—who were deprived by war
of the right to fulfil that duty.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then he found himself repeating over and over a phrase:
“Little moments of happiness.... Little moments of
happiness....” If men were to be wasted as they
had been wasted this night, and if God could sit quiescent
in His heaven, tolerating such wastage, then could that
God deny to women their little moments of happiness as
a partial, an infinitesimal, balm for the agony He permitted?
Could He frown upon those little moments, or
decree them to be evil?... He wondered how God
stood on this question of morals. In a moment came an
answer, but Kendall could not assert it to be a true
answer. It was this: “<i>God demands another generation of
mankind.</i>”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall awoke refreshed, but with those sensations
which a man experiences after an exceedingly circumstantial
and vivid dream. The reality of last night’s
events had vanished, to be remembered only as something
lived through in that subconscious land of dreams. The
morning was bright, cheerful, and he breakfasted with
enthusiasm. Directly afterward Jimmy was summoned
to brigade headquarters, and Kendall, having finished
his work at that point, set out with his chauffeur to walk
back to Domptin.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the way they paused on the road to watch the
shelling out of a corner of the woods by a German battery.
The high-explosive shells fell with beautiful precision and
at regular intervals of about a minute. The scream of
the shells could be heard during an interval in which one
could count up to six slowly, and then would come the
explosion. By counting so and keeping his eyes on that
wooded angle Kendall could watch the work of the shells
with exact timing of his vision. Somehow the processes
of the explosion reminded him of an enormously powerful
man heaving upward a weight with his shoulders. First
would come a small surge of smoke, as if the giant were
testing his load, and then an uprush of black smoke and
debris in geyser form, regular until it had spent its force,
then breaking into irregular billows at the top and dissipating
through the air.... Shell after shell dropped
precisely, neatly, not varying in their placing by more
than a couple of score of feet.... About the corner was
no sign of life, no hurrying figures stumbling headlong
away from the peril, and Kendall wondered if life were
present there, if life had been there, or if it had wholly
ceased to exist.</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked on down the road to their car and returned
to Montreuil, where Kendall had business with the
Assistant Provost Marshal, who occupied a house on the
edge of town, midway down the winding hill. As Ken’s
car drew up at the house a gray camion stopped at an adjoining
cottage, and Kendall saw a girl leap briskly down
from the seat and run up the bank. She wore the uniform
of the Y. M. C. A.... He recognized Maude Knox.</p>

<p class='c006'>His first impulse was to hasten to her, for he was as much
delighted as astonished to see her in such a place, but
something stopped him—call it curiosity. He was conscious
of wanting to see how she acted, what she was
doing, how she did it.... An American girl alone in a
French hamlet deserted by its civil population! A girl
alone with an army! Here was indeed a situation; here
was romance; here was something to excite the imagination!
Kendall leaned forward eagerly and watched.</p>

<p class='c006'>She entered the open door of the little cottage and
looked within; then she turned about in the most matter-of-fact
way and called something to the man who drove
the truck. He dismounted and began unloading cases
and crates—and a cook-stove. These he carried up the
bank and placed in the house. Maude shook hands with
the man; he climbed on his camion again and drove away.
She was alone!... She, an American girl, had been set
down casually in a matter-of-course manner here within
range of hostile guns, and abandoned to her own devices!
She seemed not in the least excited or disturbed. It was
amazing. This sort of thing might have been happening
to her every day or so for years, and yet Kendall knew
she had never, probably, spent a night alone in a house
before in her life.... And here she was more than alone
in a house. There was not another woman within miles....
He saw her attempting to fasten a sign to the wall
beside the door, and, failing, turn and look about her for
the first time.... Seventy-fives were being discharged
every few minutes from points not a quarter of a mile
away from her. He saw that she was gazing toward the
sound.... He shook his head, for the thing was beyond
his comprehension. Did American girls do this sort of
thing? Was this expected of them? Were they all
capable of such adaptations of themselves, or was Maude
Knox a remarkable exception? He wondered....</p>

<p class='c006'>There was nothing more to be seen. Maude had gone
inside, and Kendall stepped from his car and walked up
to her door, on whose threshold he paused, not speaking,
and peered inside. She was standing in the middle of a
rubbish-littered room, looking about her, not with bewilderment
or with uncertainty, but calculatingly. She
seemed the embodiment of capability.... She nodded
her head as much as to say, “This will do nicely,” and
reached for a broom that was among the boxes that had
accompanied her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good morning,” said Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>She turned and looked at him, smiling even before she
recognized him, and then exclaimed, “Kendall Ware, of
all people!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of all people, indeed! How about yourself? I presume
you are a natural and normal part of the scenery.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She nodded. “Of course. This is what I came to
France to do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To—to be set down on a pile of filth like this”—his
arm swept the room—“alone—in the middle of an army—within
a couple of miles of No Man’s Land?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course.... Why not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Aren’t you—afraid?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was actually surprised; there was no pretense
about it. “Of what?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>He shrugged his shoulders. “I’ll bet you never slept
alone in a house before in your life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You wouldn’t do it at home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He waggled his head. “You’d have been afraid to stay
alone in a house in a civilized town.... Now, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I guess I would. Yes, I would.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But here—with nothing to protect you, without even
a decent lock—and not a woman within half a dozen
kilometers!... It isn’t right. They hadn’t any business
sending you to such a place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rubbish!... I’m safer than I would be in my own
home with a policeman standing in front of the door.
Why, I’ve never even thought of being nervous! Really....
I suppose it is queer.” She stopped a moment to
speculate on its queerness. “If I were back home and
somebody should describe this to me I couldn’t understand
any girl doing it.... But I’m here—and it’s all
different.... I never felt so—so <i>safe</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But an army—even our army—is made up of all sorts
of men.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed with sincerity. “Fiddlesticks!... What
do you suppose would happen to a man who offended me?
Why, Kendall”—it was the first time she had used his
given name, but it appeared perfectly natural—“I’ve
got a whole division to look after me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was true. He knew it was true. These American
boys—lonely for a familiar American face, hungry for the
sound of the voice and laughter of an American woman—would
idolize her. They would be her slaves. Safe?...
There never had been such safety as was hers—and yet
he was troubled. It was so unconventional—so off the
beaten track of the ordinary movement of life. He did
not quite like it.... That was his mother speaking in
him. His mother would have declared such conduct to
be unwomanly, to be not nice, and she would have
condemned Maude Knox unheard.... Because Maude
Knox was doing a thing <i>she</i> had never done and had
never seen done by a respectable member of her sex!...
Kendall realized this to be absurd.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’re surely in a different world,” he said, tritely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Epworth Sewing Circle wouldn’t approve,” she
said, with a twinkle, “but the Epworth Sewing Circle
doesn’t count over here, does it?... I wonder if it will
ever count again anywhere—for us who have been here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall wondered, too. What was going to become of
the home conventions when these young women, who
had adventured to France to aid as they found opportunity
in the winning of the war, got home? What ideas
would they bring with them and disseminate? What
would happen to America?... America could never
be the same, for, not only would these thousands of girls
return, having seen the world with opened eyes—and
lived undreamable lives—but two millions of young men
would be going home, too.... Each one of them would
take something of France and of the war to his home—and
what would come of it?...</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re—you’re <i>bully</i>!” he said, with sudden conviction.
“By Jove! you’re <i>bully</i>!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fiddlesticks!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are you here for?... What do you expect
to do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Talk, mostly,” she said, merrily. “I guess that’s
what I’m wanted for more than anything else—to let
the boys talk to me. Incidentally I’ll make hot chocolate
and sell cigarettes and safety razors and jam and cookies....
I’ll just be here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just be here,” he repeated after her. “Just be
here....” And in a flash as of lightning he saw what
her just being here would mean to those men.... He
saw what a lofty height they would set her upon, and
how they would worship her beauty, and how they would
delight in her every word.... It would be good for
them, good for them as soldiers and good for them as
men!... What a war it was that produced this!...</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look!” she said, and laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall turned. The doorway was closed by a rapidly
augmenting crowd of boys in khaki, curious, eager, delighted,
grinning.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How do you do?” Maude said, with perfect calm.
She walked toward them and extended her hand, which
boy after boy seized bashfully. “I’m Miss Knox—and
if you ever expect to get any hot chocolate, somebody’s
got to put up the stove. It isn’t much of a stove.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say, miss,” blurted out a sergeant, “if you’ll—er—git
out of here a spell we’ll fix things up.... Say, was you
calc’latin’ on stayin’?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m a permanent improvement,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>From that instant Kendall had no doubts, conjured up
no violated proprieties. Maude Knox was <i>right</i> to be
there; there was no other spot in the world where it
was so right for her to be....</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll clear out,” she said, and, pausing as she passed
through the door, “I could use some sort of a counter....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You bet, miss.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There,” said Maude to Kendall, presently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I see,” he said, soberly. “I’m seeing lots of things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That weren’t visible in Detroit,” she added for him.
Then, after a pause, “And so am I.... There’s something
in the air—here—in Paris—wherever one goes in
this country. It <i>gets</i> you.... I could do things. Yes,
I could.... You have a feeling that nothing you do
as an individual counts—nothing matters. Everything
we’ve ever been used to seems so far away and insignificant.
Don’t you feel that way?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As if you could be very good or very, very bad—and
it wouldn’t make a cent’s worth of difference to anybody?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Other girls are feeling it. I think they are all feeling
it. There are plenty of signs.... <i>C’est la guerre.</i> I
suppose that’s it.... No, it can’t be explained by a
phrase of the streets; it’s deeper than that.... With
one half of the world trying to slaughter the other half....
Every little while I have a feeling that right and
wrong have grown to be too big to apply to individuals—they’re
for <i>nations</i>. Does that express what I mean?
And then I’ve thought more than once that this is the
end of the world—the end of the old world and the
starting-place of a new one.... Temporarily we’re
without a set of rules because the old ones won’t do any
more, and we’ve got to build up an altogether new code.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve felt something like that, but I didn’t have a
philosopher for a father, so I didn’t know just what I
was feeling or how to say it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’re being a sort of spiritual Bolsheviki, I suppose,
going through a transition period of confusion and lawlessness
and wild thinking.... But, just as something
better than the old Russian Empire with its czars and
grand dukes and Siberias and its—its <i>Rasputins</i>—is
bound to follow Bolsheviki-ism, so something better than
the narrowness of the sewing-circles and the Pilgrims
and the viciousness of blindly accepted conventions and
codes.... This has turned into something bigger than
a World War—it is turning into a Greater Reformation....
Not the reformation of a religion, but a reformation
in the basic <i>thought</i> of the world—surely of America....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Whew!” exclaimed Kendall. “I follow you, I guess,
but my feet are off the bottom ... and I can’t swim.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can think, can’t you?” she said, a trifle tartly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I guess I <i>feel</i> more than I <i>think</i>,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We all do.... We have to feel in order to think,
and we have to feel in order to understand. Cold logic
isn’t worth a snap of the fingers—really.... You’ve
been getting something out of Paris, haven’t you? Feeling
something? I think you get it there more than any
place else.... I love Paris.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My mother wouldn’t love it,” he said, gravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you’re like her—sometimes—aren’t you?...
But aren’t you growing more tolerant—more able to see
the other person’s point of view?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—hang it all!—I can’t get away from the notion
that good is good and bad is bad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She shook her head. “But you are beginning to see
that America hasn’t the right to legislate for the world,
and to define what is good and what is evil.... I know
you are.... Now don’t be shocked, please. I’m American,
of course, and the American code is for me—until
it is altered. Whatever I may think about it, still it is
the code and accepted by the majority. That binds me to
a degree.... But I can still believe we are narrow and
prudish.... It doesn’t take much imagination to understand
that eating pork may be a sin to an orthodox Jew.
It is a sin because he believes it is a sin. It is no sin for
you because you think it is nonsense.... When you
get down to essentials, the thing that is a <i>sin</i> is doing a
thing you <i>think</i> to be a sin. It isn’t the <i>thing</i>, but the
thinking....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose that’s it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course it is.... And that’s enough of this sort of
talk, isn’t it? I don’t always talk this way, really. I’m
quite pleasant and frivolous most of the time....
You’re not to be stationed here by any chance?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No such luck.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed. “I wouldn’t have time to bother with
you, anyhow, if you were meaning that as a compliment....
I’ve got at least a regiment of young men, and I
sha’n’t be partial.... Besides, there’s that pretty little
French girl.... I liked her looks.... Tell the truth,
you’d be heartbroken if you were sent away from Paris
and her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree!... He had scarcely remembered her existence
for twenty-four hours. And only the night before last
he had been telling her that he loved her, and kissing
her good-by! He felt ashamed of himself. He felt
ashamed because he felt that he was not being true
to the love he professed for her—in his thoughts and in the
pleasure which he found in the presence of Maude Knox....
He <i>was</i> in love with Andree, but—confound it all!—was
it possible he could be falling in love with Maude
Knox, too? He had heard that people and books asserted
a man could be in love with two women at once....
If this were so, he said to himself, it would create
a devilish unpleasant situation ... and a situation not
without an element to cause laughter. If a man loved
two girls, he would have to choose one of them. In which
case he would be, at the same instant, in a state of bliss
because he had won a sweetheart and in a state of heartbreak
because he had been thwarted in love!...</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish you could know Andree,” he said. “She—she’s
educating me, I guess. I don’t understand her, of
course. She is constantly startling me. I never knew
anybody who in the least resembled her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course not.... She’s French. She’s a war-time
Parisienne.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But she’s good,” said Kendall, as if Maude had
brought some charge against Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why not?” Maude smiled a trifle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mustn’t think—” he began.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m thinking nothing. It’s none of my business.”
She paused. “Frankly, I don’t care.... Now don’t
misunderstand that. I like you, Kendall. I’m interested
in you. There was a time when, if I suspected of a
man what you seem to think I suspect of you, I would
have cut him in a hurry.... And the girl—I would
have been horrified.... But now—I don’t quite understand
myself—I wouldn’t in the least object to knowing
your Andree.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I tell you—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course you do—and I don’t believe you. So
there!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was embarrassed and a trifle angry. “I don’t
see why you should suspect anything—just because
Andree is French!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And because you are American? And because lots of
things?” She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you marry a man you knew had been having
an—an affair with a girl like Andree?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It would depend. There are affairs and affairs....
Somehow I don’t think I should marry a man who had an
affair with an American woman, one of these squalid,
scandalous things we hear about in New York or Detroit....
But in war conditions—with a girl like Andree,
as you say, why, if I loved the man of course I would
marry him.... I think I would—if I loved him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where is the difference?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know.... It gets back to a sin being a sin
because you think it is. It’s a feeling. I’ve seen these
women in France, women I knew were having affairs, and
they were sweet and modest—and natural. An American
woman can’t seem to have an affair and still be sweet and
modest—and natural. She feels she is doing something
wicked and degrading, and consequently is degraded.
She is being deliberately bad.... Don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I think so.... There’s something. I have the
same notion about it as you, but I couldn’t explain it.
I guess you’re right.... Do you think a man can be in
love with two girls at once?” He asked the question
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed joyously. “Now, you aren’t going to tell
me you are in love with me, too?... Please don’t. I
suppose a lot of these boys will fancy they’re in love with
me just because I happen to be moderately neat and
clean and good-looking and because I’m out here alone
like this.... I’ll stand to them for their sweethearts
back home, and all that, but they won’t be in love with
me in the least—and neither are you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This frankness was truly American, modern American.
Kendall could not imagine Andree saying or thinking
such things; he could not imagine his mother saying or
thinking such things. And why? To Andree love was
love—the great business of life. Everything else was
subordinate to it. To his mother love was—was just a
little bit off color, because there was sex in it. His
mother could love her son frankly, but she could not love
her husband frankly nor talk with frankness about it....
Original sin clung to love in her mind. It was the
thing that had cast man out of Paradise, and while one
married and bore children, and marital relations were
necessary, nevertheless there was something squalid and
indecent about them. Andree saw nothing indecent in
sex, as she saw nothing indecent in eating her dinner....
Maude Knox was more like Andree than like his mother,
but even there there was a vast difference. There was
the difference of race and of racial philosophy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude placed her hand on Kendall’s arm. “Be nice to
that little girl,” she said. “Don’t hurt her.... Be fair.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you mean?... Do you mean I should
marry her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She hesitated. “I don’t know.... Marriage!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her own inherited prejudices were lifting their heads
now. Marriage!... Marriage with a French girl with
whom one was having relations! That was different. She
hesitated and did not give him a frank answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well?” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mustn’t ask me.... I can’t answer that. It
is a thing you’ll have to decide.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I guess you have answered,” he said, gloomily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps—and perhaps I’m ashamed of myself for
answering so.... But I was born in America and
brought up in a surrounding of sewing-circles.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a pause. Then he said, almost as if to himself,
“You’re the sort of girl I’d like to be in love with.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s a very nice thing to say—but you’re not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know.... I’m not sure. I could be very
easily if I were to see much of you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And Andree?...”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was really depressed, worried, and she perceived it
with genuine sympathy. She saw that this young man
was facing a problem whose correct solution would be
vital to his happiness and to his future peace of mind.
She was able to realize that he was approaching one of
those climaxes of the soul which are infinitely more trying
and infinitely more potent to modify than could any
climax in which the physical predominated. She fancied
she knew Kendall rather well and understood him. She
fancied he was not complex, but rather simple and
straightforward—just a young man—but she was wrong.
There were such elements of complexity in him as made
for the sharpest of suffering, which would have defied
the analysis of the most expert psychologist. She did
not perceive the overwhelming importance of his inheritances
from mother and father, those beliefs and those
sensations and those reactions which were almost a
physical part of him as his arms and legs were a physical
part of him. She could not know that his body was in
constant use as an arena in which Puritanism and dogmas
and blind faiths and intolerances of the unknown were
battling with that mild toleration derived from his father,
that desire to see good in everything, that sweetness
which held fast to its faith in mankind, even when it
could not understand what mankind was about.... Nor
could she know that Kendall himself stood between these
adversaries with a mind better equipped than either to
see and to appraise, striving with a great hunger for the
right, to be modified by the adversaries only as it was
right to be modified by them. Youth and the desires of
youth for life and pleasure and the knowledge that comes
by experiencing was also there with its immature carelessness
of consequences.... There was no simplicity here,
rather such a complexity as seemed destined to defy solution
and to make a decent peace of the soul a thing
possible to attain....</p>

<p class='c006'>A young captain ran down the bank to meet them.
“You are Miss Knox?” he asked, cordially.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m Captain Morris, A.P.M. here—and I’m mighty glad
to see you. You don’t mean you’re really going to stay?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Really.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>No!</i>... By Jove!... Say!...” He was inarticulate,
but there was no doubting of his delight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Captain Ware—Captain Morris,” said Maude, and
the two young men shook hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve got some business with you,” Kendall said, “as
soon as we can get Miss Ware settled.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you want? What do you need?...”
This to Maude: “I’ll give you details of men till the cows
come home. Just ask for it, and—if it’s in this sector—we’ll
get it for you.... By Jove!... Think of it!
Going to stay!... Oh, say!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude laughed. “You’ll have me thinking I’m doing
something unusual in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Unusual! Miss Knox, if you knew what it will mean
to these boys to have an American girl here—just to know
she’s around! It’s wonderful, that’s what it is! Do you
realize that some of the men haven’t seen an American
woman in a year—haven’t talked to a woman?... By
Jove!...” Every time he thought about it he became
boyishly inarticulate again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They’re fixing up my canteen for me,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good! I’ll run up and see they do it right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I wouldn’t, if I were you,” said Maude, gently.
“They seem to like it—to want to do it themselves. They
shooed me away. Don’t you think it would be better
to let them go ahead by themselves—if it pleases them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was conscious of a pride in her, in her understanding
and her beautiful tact. So was Captain Morris,
who could only stare at her unbelievingly and utter,
“By Jove!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>In half an hour they three walked back to the canteen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here she comes!” yelled a boy in the door, and a
sergeant with a smudge on his nose, his sleeves rolled up,
and a hammer in his hand, poked his nose out of the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shoo her off ag’in,” he said, in a rumble that was distinctly
audible, though not intended for Maude’s ears.
“We hain’t done yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude turned away with a laugh. “I guess we’d better
walk some more. If you men are busy I can look after
myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Busy!...” exclaimed Captain Morris. “By Jove!”
And they all laughed, even the captain, who had a faint
perception of his own state of mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>In another half-hour they returned again to the little
cottage. This time a dozen boys were standing about
with a great pretense of carelessness, but with an embarrassed
eagerness which set her eyes to twinkling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“May I go in now?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, ma’am.... You bet!”</p>

<p class='c006'>They crowded in after her to watch her every movement
and expression and to assure themselves that they had
pleased her. There was a serviceable counter. Behind
it were rough shelves for her wares. The stove was set
up, and such utensils as she possessed hung precisely on
nails. There was a comfortable chair, rather dilapidated,
but foraged at some expense of trouble.... And the
cleanliness of the place was nothing short of amazing.
It had been swept and dusted and scoured until not a
trace of its former filth remained.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, boys,” said Maude, after a moment’s silence,
“isn’t it fine!... Haven’t you made a nice place of it!
I wouldn’t have thought it was possible.... And the
counter and shelving!... I don’t know how to thank
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The soldiers were in a dreadful state of embarrassment,
blushing and giggling and nudging one another like schoolboys
detected in a prank. They seemed to have a feeling
that something ought to be said, for they kept jostling
and pushing the sergeant, who growled back at them,
savagely. “Lemme be, doggone you!” Maude heard him
mutter. But they pushed him out into consciousness.
“Go on, Hank.... Open up. Git it off your chest,”
he was abjured.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hank scowled terribly at Maude, opened his mouth
and closed it again, hunched his broad shoulders and felt
of his prominent Adam’s apple. “Aw—” he began, and
then, “Aw—hell!...” With which well-chosen remark
he burst through his comrades and fled headlong.</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude again did the one tactful thing, the one thing
that, in those circumstances, not only saved the face of
the vanished Hank, but raised her to an elevation in the
minds of the soldiers from which she would never descend....
She simply sat down on that scoured floor and
laughed and laughed until her cheeks were wet with tears
of mirth. So infectious was her laugh that there was not
a man but laughed with her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“By Jove!...” exclaimed Captain Morris. “She’s
a wonder.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is,” said Kendall, soberly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude looked up at them. “You officers go away,”
she said, severely. “I’m going to be very busy.... No,
you boys needn’t go—just the officers....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I may come back to say good-by?” Kendall asked.
“I’ll be leaving in an hour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Kendall finished his business with the Assistant
Provost Marshal he returned to the canteen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m going,” he said from the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude issued from behind her counter and made her
way through a knot of soldiers who had crowded about it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-by,” she said, extending her hand. “It’s been
nice to see you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It—it has been wonderful to see you,” he said. “I
don’t think I shall ever forget this.” He waved his hand
around the room. “It isn’t possible.” He smiled
whimsically. “I know I’m dreaming the whole thing.
You’re really back in Ohio somewhere, probably playing
bridge.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not bridge—I don’t like bridge. Tennis, maybe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I’m going to wake up in a little while and tell
folks what a queer dream I’ve had.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She pinched herself. “See, I’m awake—and you don’t
know how glad I am that I am awake—that I am here,
seeing this, being a part of this....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But it isn’t done, you know. There’s nothing in the
rules to cover it.... No, Miss Knox, I’m dreaming it—and
I’m glad I am dreaming it. If it were real—” His
face grew serious.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps,” she said, “this is the first time you’ve ever
seen anything real ... since you came to France. That
is it.... France is real, the war is real, Andree is real,
I am real.... The only things that aren’t real are the
habits and thoughts we were busy with sixty days ago....
Sixty days!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-by—and don’t forget me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I sha’n’t do that. I like you.... Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall leaned far back in his car and smoked and
found his thoughts disturbing company. He was not
used to facing questions of big importance, but he saw
now that for weeks he had been drifting toward a day
when he would have to meet and reply to the first soul-modifying
question that had ever been propounded to
him.... The thing was inevitable. He was moving
toward facts that could not be brushed aside....
Strangely enough, though he was heavy with apprehension,
nevertheless there was a certain exultation....
This was living—living not in a circumscribed area, but
in the unbounded world. This was <i>life</i>—this was <i>experience</i>—something
big, worthy of the consideration of a
man. There were happiness and misery in it.... He
was beginning to see that he could not win through with
happiness intact; it was his hope to win through with
happiness preponderant.... The day he landed in
France he had been a boy; less than two months had
passed—and he had become a man.... France had
done that for him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On the fourth evening after his departure from Paris
Captain Ware stood at the entrance to the Metro
on the Place de la Concorde, just across the road from
the headquarters of the American Red Cross, waiting for
Andree. At his left the Obelisk arose like a great
needle; he could see the Metz and Strasburg statues
green with wreaths, and beyond other pieces of sculpture
deemed of sufficient artistic value to protect with sandbags
from the menace of German bombs. Somehow this
made him feel that he had not seen Paris, that it would be
necessary for him to come back again when the base
of the Vendôme Column should not be concealed by
sand and concrete, when the carvings on the Arc de
Triomphe should not be hidden under scaffoldings and
stacked sandbags, when the once despised and criticized
statue at the extreme right of the face of the Opéra—now
the single piece of sculpture of all that adorned the
building considered worth careful protection—should be
exposed to view.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was an analogy between the hooded statues and
the spirit of the city. He wanted to see both when they
were as they had been before August, 1914. He wanted
to see Paris when it was gay, beautiful, carefree, buoyant,
volatile. How much more it would mean to see it so
after having seen it as it was now.... Just across from
him was a wall upon which was a poster exclaiming,
“<i>Abri, 40 places</i>.” He wanted to see Paris without that
fear riding its shoulders. He wanted to see it when
every fourth or fifth shop had not its shutters down in
permanence, explained by a sign which gave notice that
the closing was by reason of the mobilization.... And
yet it was beautiful, compellingly beautiful. Suddenly
the certainty came upon him that a people whose genius
could have created such a city could not be <i>wrong</i>. He
had been told that the genius of the French was rotten
at the core, its morals corrupt. He knew in this moment
that it was a lie.... Such a city could not have been
produced by a people who were decadent, who were not
of the greatest, the worthiest of the earth....</p>

<p class='c006'>In a moment Andree appeared, in a flimsy dress of light
material this time, a dress that came just to her shoe-tops.
It made her look even slenderer than he had
remembered her to be, and more childish.... He
waited for her to speak. She approached almost to his
side before she seemed to see him, then she raised her eyes
quickly, searchingly, to his face and let them fall again.
But he had read anxiety and relief in that flickering
glance. She shook hands, giving him a trusting little
pressure of her fingers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see,” he said, “I promised to come back safe.
The <i>boches</i> didn’t get me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is ver’ well. If the <i>boches</i> keel you I am ver’ angry—me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you been lonely for me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!...” she said, and raised her eyes again for an
instant. “And you—do you think of me? But, no.
You have been <i>très-occupé</i>—ver’ busy.... And you have
seen other girls.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She asked no questions about the front, showed no
desire to hear about the affairs of war. Poor child!
Like the great multitude of her sisters, she was tired of
war, bored with war. In her mind was only one question
about the war—when would it end?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert and Madeleine are going to dine with us,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is well.... Monsieur Bert—is he well? And
Madeleine? Have you seen her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That high yo’ng man!” she said, and laughed. “Oh,
it is not nice for you to make fon of me. High....
Tall.... How shall one tell them apart?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t try,” Kendall said. Then he laughed at his
recollections of her blunders in a strange language. “At
what hour do you lift up?” he mimicked her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have study English since you have gone away. I
know that now. It is not <i>lift up</i>; it is raise up. At what
hour do you raise up in the morning. <i>N’est-ce pas?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You <i>have</i> studied!” he exclaimed. “I’m proud of
you. But you speak English better than I do now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better than you do French,” she said, with a little
grimace.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What have you been doing while I was away?” he
asked, and asked because he was really curious. He
wanted to know something about her life away from
him, about her regular routine life. To him now she was
a creature that appeared as out of a fog, to disappear
again into a fog, untraceable, strange, mysterious. She
must do something. She must have a family. She must
live in a house and sleep in a bed and take her meals at a
table. It must be that she had her friends and her
little every-day affairs, different, perhaps, from the every-day
affairs of the American girl, but nevertheless taking
up the greater part of her life.... He wished he could
have the history of one of her days from waking to sleeping,
could be present to oversee one of her days.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have been lonely,” she said. So she always answered,
and, it seemed to him, not from any conscious effort to hide
her life from him, but rather because when she was with
him it was her belief that nothing was of interest to them
but each other. It was as if she wanted to shut all the
rest of the world out, forget all the world and its business,
and remember only themselves and their little moments
of happiness together. No, it was not concealment, it
was the exclusiveness of love. “I—many times—I
thought you would not come.... And I was sad.”
She pressed his arm gently.</p>

<p class='c006'>They boarded the red car—first class—of the Metro,
and it started its rather leisurely journey westward under
the Place de la Concorde and the Champs Élysées.
Kendall always insisted on riding first class on the subway,
though Andree urged it was a scandalous waste
of money. One could ride as comfortably second class,
or, if the trip were very short, the saving by taking third
class was worth one’s while. The car was crowded—women,
a few old men in civilian clothes, <i>poilus</i>, officers
(one with four medals on his breast), Belgians with little
gold tassels dangling from the fronts of their caps, two
English soldiers in an advanced state of intoxication who
recognized Kendall as belonging to a kindred race and
shouted joyously to him from afar.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hey, matey, does this ’ere car git us to the Gare
St.-Nizaire?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Needn’t be so dam’ close-mouthed. Speak up like
you was a officer and a gen’lman! ’Urrah for America,
says I. ’Ear me, Jock? Wi’ a will, Jock.... ’Urrah
for America.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With enthusiasm they cheered for their newest ally,
while Kendall blushed with the embarrassment of finding
himself thus elevated to a place of prominence. The car
laughed joyfully and in sympathy with the Britishers.
Andree looked up into Kendall’s face and, finding it
forbidding, pressed his arm and smiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Beaucoup</i> de zigzag,” she said, philosophically, as if
that explained all and excused all.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not until they alighted at the Étoile that Kendall
was rid of the attentions of his friends, and even there
one of them leaned out of the front door as Ken descended
from the rear and shouted: “Give me love to your lidy
friend, ol’ top.... ’Urrah for President Wilson....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall did not regain his equanimity until they were
nearing the apartment; it was the more difficult to regain
because he had a feeling that Andree was laughing at
him a bit, notwithstanding her grave face. He felt,
somehow, that the necessity for maintaining dignity at
all times—a foible of American youth—was not to be
understood by Andree, and fell under that category of
actions which she described as “<i>C’est drôle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Madame the <i>concierge</i> greeted them with affability;
the big glass door slammed behind them as it always did
when Kendall forgot to hold it carefully, and the sound
of its slamming echoed hollowly up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the first floor Andree paused and clung to the
banister. “Oh, you must have—what you call—?” She
made a lifting motion with her hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“An elevator?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yes.... Now. At once. Go. Run quickly
and fetch an elevator. I shall stay here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He made pretense of lifting her in his arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.... No.... I must have an elevator. Oh,
you do not get me an elevator.” There was awful
despair in her voice. “You do not love me.... No....
Then I shall go away. You are not kind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll get you two elevators. I’ll get you half a dozen,
but the elevator-store is closed for the night. You’ll have
to wait till morning.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I do not onderstan’. You speak <i>trop vite</i>—much
fast. So I shall ron away from you....” And she
danced away from him up the stairs, not at all like a
young woman, but wholly like a child, with the glee of a
child. “Behol’!” she cried, presently. “The <i>clef</i> it is
under the mat. I find it. I know where it is hidden.
Now I shall come by night and rob you.... I shall
carry away everything—everything.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She handed him the huge key and he opened the door
for her and allowed her to pass into the narrow hall.
She stopped timidly, waiting for him to enter, peering
about as if some danger might lurk behind any of the
doors. She was very sweet, very dainty....</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne</i>,” he said, and took both her hands—and
then she was in his arms, her lips to his ... and he knew
that he loved her, that she had charmed his heart into
her keeping—and that he was very glad to have it there.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You love me?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Much.... Much.... And you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh yes.... I am not <i>solitaire</i> now. <i>Je suis très-joyeuse.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must always be glad. You must always be
happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As long as you love me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall always love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non!... Non!...</i> It ees not possible. In a day,
in a week—I do not know when—you will go away, and
I will be sad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know when I shall have to go, nor where I
shall have to go.... It is the war.... But whenever
and wherever, I shall love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well—but—but I do not believe you.... Oh,
life it is not well! It is our <i>besoin</i>—our need—to find
many little minutes. That is the best of life. I know.... Much
sadness, much loneliness ... but now and
then the little minutes of happiness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was hanging her tam-o’-shanter on the hall tree,
then he led her into the <i>salon</i> with its bronze statues and
its gilded furniture, at which she did not wrinkle her
nose this time, for she was in serious mood.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you always happy?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m not often unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is ver’ well—yes.... It is not so well as to be
happy, but it is better than to be sad.... Me, I am
often sad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll put a stop to that. From now on you must be
happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come—you must sit close to me—ver’ close—<i>so</i>....”
She had seated herself by the table and was looking at a
magazine, a French periodical filled with pictures of young
women in one-piece bathing-suits. “They are ver’
beautiful,” she said, slipping her arm about his neck
and pressing her cheek to his. “I should like to be
beautiful—yes. That would be well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Vous étes très-jolie</i>,” he protested.</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed. “No, but I like you to tell me.... You
theenk I am pretty?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You bet I do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well. Then for you I am pretty, and I am glad.... Also
I am ver’ nice, and ver’ wise, n’est-ce pas?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are the cunningest little person that ever lived.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hush!... There is some one. Listen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert and Madeleine,” he said, as he heard a key
fumbling in the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I mus’ be ver’ <i>sérieuse</i>—so.” She sat erect,
very primly, her hands folded in her lap—a very image
of gravity and circumspection. Presently Bert and
Madeleine entered the room. The girls shook hands
gravely and exchanged a few words. Then Madeleine
shook hands with Kendall and Bert with Andree. Everybody
must shake hands before matters could proceed.
Once disposed of, formality relaxed; the girls chattered
in French, Madeleine with laughing vivacity and many
gestures, Andree rather as if she were a bit embarrassed,
always searching Madeleine with her eyes as she studied
every new-comer into her acquaintance. Her eyes were
always studying, studying, but she never disclosed what
they told her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette opened the door of the dining-room very softly
and allowed her head to project into the room. She did
so very discreetly and silently, as if she were afraid of
being detected in the act of announcing dinner. She
uttered no word, but allowed her head to remain, round
and big-eyed, until it should be seen—like the sign of a
restaurant making its silent announcement. Kendall
caught her eye, and in a twinkling she disappeared with
comical haste—a pudgy jack-in-a-box.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dinner is served,” Kendall said, “and I’m hungry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A fine, thick soup steamed in a huge bowl in the middle
of the table, and Arlette watched with big-eyed anxiety
while Bert served it. Before any one could taste a spoonful
her impatience overcame her; she could contain herself
no longer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is pea soup,” she said, explosively.</p>

<p class='c006'>Madeleine laughed, showing her fine white teeth. “It
is very good,” she said in French.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Monsieur Kendall does not like,” exclaimed Arlette,
in heartrending accents as she perceived that Ken did not
at once address himself to the <i>potage</i>, but sat regarding
Andree, forgetful of everything else.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh yes, he does,” said Bert, “but Monsieur Kendall
is in love. Presently if he does not eat I shall feed him.... Arlette,”
he demanded, severely, “are you in love
with some young man?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ho!...” she exclaimed, and, overcome with embarrassed
giggles, scurried out of the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>C’est drôle</i>,” said Andree, judgmatically.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is red wine or white wine desired?” Arlette asked from
the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Suppose we try a bottle of that Anjou Rose,” said
Ken. “I like the color of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anjou!” exclaimed Madeleine. “Ah, that is my
country. I am born there.... The wine of Anjou it
is ver’ well.... I shall go soon to visit in that country—to,
if possible, sell a house. Yes. Oh, it is mos’
beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree regarded her speculatively, gravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Before the war my father owns the store of the shoes
there. There is a yo’ng man work in thees store, and I
am ver’ yo’ng. I do not know theengs. <i>Mais non</i>. I
am marry thees yo’ng man, but he ees no good—him.
My father die, my mother die, and I am <i>orpheline</i>. It
ees ver’ bad for me, bicause my <i>oncle</i> and thees yo’ng
man they take away the store of the shoes and I have
not’ing only thees house. It ees so. Thees yo’ng man
he ees ver’ bad; he is not <i>fidèle</i>; also he is mos’ unkind.
Then he go to the war, and I never see him since. I
theenk he is dead.... It ees ver’ well. But my oncle
he lives—but I have not’ing. It is ver’ necessary I mus’
eat, so I come to Paris and work in the store of the shoes.... Now,
ver’ soon I go to my country for sell thees
house and to have a leetle money.” She shrugged her
shoulders and laughed. “I do not cry—no, I laugh.
Much time I laugh, bicause why not? It is ver’ <i>nécessaire</i>
to laugh and be happy. Is it not so, my Bert?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Laugh all you like, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree raised her eyes to Madeleine’s face. “Oh, it
ees too bad,” she said. “Thees husban’ and thees
<i>oncle</i> they are ver’ wicked.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus encouraged, Madeleine amplified her autobiography
in an avalanche of headlong French, while
Andree listened unsmilingly and nodded her head now
and then, or waggled it a trifle in sympathy or condemnation
of some related atrocity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see,” she said to Kendall, “no one is happy. It
is so. Life it is not nice—for yo’ng girls.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“One mus’ theenk not about the sad theengs,” said
Madeleine, sententiously. “One mus’ be happy. That
ees best. Me—I take what comes.... See, I am ver’
ol’. <i>Oui....</i> I am twenty-four. So ol’ am I that no
man ever want to marry me.... <i>Tiens!</i> I am <i>passée</i>.
But still I laugh.... I love Monsieur Bert, and I am
happy. One day Monsieur Bert love me no more....”
She shrugged her shoulders. “Then I am sad for leetle
w’ile.... But another yo’ng man he will love me,
perhaps. It ees so. What would you?... If one does
not love and is not loved, then there is no happiness,
<i>n’est-ce pas</i>?...”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree nodded. “When there is no love it is terrible,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert laughed and looked at Kendall. “Aha!” he said.
“But, mademoiselle, Ken says you and he do not love
each other—that you are just <i>camarades</i>....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was so,” she said, “but now”—she looked at Kendall
gravely—“it is so no longer. No.... We love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I said to you,” Madeleine addressed Kendall, “that
French girls are not cold. Did I not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But—” Kendall began to expostulate and to explain.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Madeleine would have none of it. “You are ver’
<i>sérieux</i>, monsieur. Doubtless you are also <i>un religieux</i>!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Religieux?</i> What is that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She means in English a monk,” said Andree, her eyes
twinkling. “To wear a brown robe—<i>oui!</i>—and also bare
feet and sandals.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It must be.” Madeleine laughed delightedly. “For
heem to look at a yo’ng girl ees a sin.... See!... See!... He
makes to blush. Regard his ear!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree laughed quietly, meantime studying Kendall’s
face with kindly, twinkling eye. She did not deride him,
but one could see that she loved to tease him—this
incomprehensible foreigner who was so <i>drôle</i>!</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall laughed, too, a bit ruefully, but while he
laughed he was thinking, fumbling for Madeleine’s point
of view. It was clear to him that the man who was not
eager for love could be no man at all—but a monk.
It was the only possible explanation. Love was for men
and women; continence was for monks. Well, then?
To love might be a sin for a monk, but even on this point
she doubtless was lenient; for a man not to love was a sin.
He was not realizing his duty to achieve happiness. Love
was love. It was good. It carried no burden of evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The good God—He make the yo’ng man and the yo’ng
girl, and He tell them to love.... It is true. Then one
must obey the good God,” she said, seriously.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here was rather a new religion to Kendall, but, somehow,
it did not seem absurd, nor did her utterance of it
touch upon the sacrilegious. She made the statement
simply, out of her heart, with simple belief.... He
turned to Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that what you think?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of a certainty—or why did the good God create men
and women and love?... I theenk God is happy when
He sees a yo’ng man and a yo’ng girl who love each other
much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some philosophy!” said Bert. “I’m for it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the love—it ees <i>nécessaire</i>....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“By Jove!...” Kendall exclaimed. “My dear, you’re
a nice child.... Bert, she’s <i>good</i>! Get that? <i>Good!...</i>
Maybe she’s right, and we’re all wrong.... Morals
are a devil of a mix-up. They’re beyond me.... But
I know this, and nobody can argue me out of it—these
girls are <i>good</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He spoke in English and rapidly. Neither girl could
follow him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert laughed. “You take it mighty seriously. What’s
the matter with you, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing’s the matter.... But a fellow can think.
It’s a big question. We’ve been taught one way—these
girls have been taught, or have learned and seen, another
way.... Who is right and who is wrong?...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fiddlesticks!” said Bert. “Why worry about it?
We’re having the time of our young lives.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They’re good,” Kendall repeated to himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who said they weren’t?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All of America.... All the world that we know.
And it must be wrong—it must be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Suits me—it’s wrong, then.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But—but the way America thinks is right in America.
That’s what I can’t understand. Right is right there, and
what America thinks is wrong seems to be right over
here....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you speak?... Oh, you speak <i>trop vite</i>. I
cannot onderstan’.” Andree made a little face of distress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was saying that you are a dear child and I love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is ver’ well.” She stretched out her tiny hand and
patted Kendall’s hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette entered with the meat, depositing it on the
table and standing by with her usual apprehension. “It
is beef,” she said. “Perhaps it is tough!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is ver’ well,” said Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette sighed with relief and waggled her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the price, mademoiselle—I ask you to regard the
price. One is frightened. It is so. For this so small
piece of meat! But messieurs demand the meat. They
spend much money, and I am alarmed. I shall be
blamed. It is I who make the purchases.... Also the
cheese ... and butter. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> The cost! It is
frightful! It is because these American soldiers arrive
in France with great wealth in their pockets and spend
with the so great freedom that prices rise.... Oh yes.
They do not care. They have no regard for money—and
in consequence the poor must pay. Can nothing be done
to prevent these Americans from making the prices to
rise?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>C’est la guerre</i>,” said Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is the Americans,” said Arlette, dogmatically.
“But one must admit they are generous and of a kindness.
I regard messieurs highly. <i>Oui. Ils sont très-gentils.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arlette likes you much,” said Andree. “I theenk she
fall in love weeth you, and I am jealous—oh, so jealous.
You shall send her away. I will not have her. She is
bad—bad. She take you away from me.” And then
she laughed low, with a charm that found its way to
Kendall’s heart. She was so cunning, so full of little
humors and tricks of manner, of moods and delightful
graces—at one moment grave and wise, at the next playful
and gay. One instant she was a woman made wise
by sorrow, the next moment she was a child, untouched
by anything but joy.... She was wonderful, thought
Kendall, there was no one in the world to compare with
her....</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’re going to the Casino de Paris to-night. Coming
along?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall turned to Andree. “Shall we?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. We shall stay here.” She pointed downward at
the floor with a gesture that was peculiarly her own. “I
have not seen you for long.... We shall talk of many
theengs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Keep your dictionary handy, Ken,” jeered Bert.
“There are lots of useful words in it.... Comme ça:
You take the lady’s hand. ‘<i>Mademoiselle, vous êtes—</i>’
Quick the dictionary! Find the first word that fits....
Here it is—look! ‘<i>Charmante.</i>’ Fine! Thus we have a
compliment with only a slight interruption. A compliment
doesn’t get cold like a dish of soup. It is still good
even if we have to look in the dictionary twice. In the
course of an evening we can get through a dozen sentences....
You shall talk of many theengs,” he finished,
mimicking Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Monsieur Bert—he does not need to speak,” laughed
Madeleine. “He is ver’ fonny. <i>Écoutez!</i> He says,
‘<i>Je no’ désirez de la potage.’ Oui.</i> Always. One understands
what he is about, but it is awful. But yes.... I
cannot teach him. No. Past or present, number, person,
it is all one for him. He jus’ make words and expects
one to understand.... But when he does not speak at
all—then he does much better.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette served the vegetable and the salad, and finally
cheese and confiture. “<i>Abricot</i> for Mademoiselle Andree,”
she explained, remembering Andree’s preference. Presently
they went into the <i>salon</i> where the boys lighted
cigarettes. Kendall tendered his case to Andree, who
selected one and lighted it daintily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought you didn’t smoke,” he said, with surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only in the house. Nevaire outside,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Madeleine did not smoke at all. Madeleine began to
walk about the room and sing “Madelon,” while Andree
looked out of the window and speculated on the characters
and peculiarities of the occupants of the apartments across
the avenue.</p>

<p class='c006'>The four turned toward the door upon hearing a
shuffling and a subdued giggling in the hall. It was
Arlette and little Arlette. The child hung back bashfully,
while her grandmother shooed her ahead with her
apron.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have brought her to see Mademoiselle Madeleine,”
she said. “I have told her, and she desires to see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The child had seen Andree, but it was necessary that
she become acquainted with the entire family, it seemed.
It was another shock for Kendall—the idea that fat,
respectable, motherly Arlette should take delight in
bringing this baby to make the acquaintance of Madeleine!...
It was impossible. In America grandmothers
would have shut their grandchildren in locked rooms to
prevent any contact with a girl about whom they had the
knowledge Arlette possessed of Madeleine.... Why,
Arlette had gotten breakfast for Madeleine in that apartment!
Yet she brought the baby to see her, and fairly
wriggled with delight when Madeleine caught little
Arlette up in her arms and kissed her and called her
endearing names. The old woman could scarcely contain
her pride and delight when Madeleine turned to tell
her how pretty the child was!... It was bewildering.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must sing,” Madeleine said to Arlette. “I know
you can sing many songs. Oh, I have heard. See.
Stand you so, and sing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So little Arlette stood erect and lifted her little chin
without embarrassment and sang, while her grandmother,
in the door, waggled her head and kept time by a ponderous
swaying of her body.... Little Arlette ran to Kendall,
always her favorite, and crawled between him and Andree,
who had seated herself beside him. She insinuated her
arm about his neck and pressed her cheek to his, while she
intrusted a hand to Andree to be held.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne!</i>” said Andree, tremulously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good efening, sirr,” said little Arlette, suddenly, and
her grandmother giggled in the very great pride of hearing
this English spoken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Aha!” said Kendall, “you study English.... She is
getting ready to go back to America with me. Yes,
indeed. I have asked for her hand. We are sweethearts,
aren’t we, Arlette?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur,” she said, very seriously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You love me very much?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You learn to cook and to sew and all the things a wife
should know?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur.... When shall we go to this America?
Is it America of the North or of the South?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of the North, <i>petite</i>....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, my uncle was once in America of the South.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not quite the same. But it is just as nice.
Really. Shall we take grandma with us when we go?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If monsieur desires.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was very serious and grown-up in her manner;
even then there was something feminine, something of the
woman in her, for she turned her face toward Andree with
eyes that seemed to say: “You see. He is mine. It is
no use for you to try to steal him from me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree made pretense to draw away from her and to
cry. “You are ver’ naughty,” she said from between her
fingers. “You steal away my sweetheart. Oh, what
shall I do?... What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Little Arlette smiled out of a great satisfaction at this
discomfiture of a rival, and openly kissed Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, come,” called Arlette. “You must not bother
monsieur. Say good night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So little Arlette shook hands all around, and backed
out of the door, throwing kisses and waving her tiny
hand, a dainty little fairy, a very breath of sweetness
and purity.... And her grandmother had not thought
it amiss to bring her to see Madeleine—for whom she
had gotten breakfast....</p>

<p class='c006'>“If we’re going to the Casino—” said Bert to Madeleine,
and got to his feet. “Sure you won’t come?” he said
to Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Merci</i>,” said Andree, positively.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See you later, then.... Good night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In a moment the door closed behind Bert, and Madeleine
and Kendall were alone with Andree.... Somehow he had
never felt the sensation of being alone with her as he felt
it now. On other occasions he had been alone merely
with a girl he knew, was somewhat interested in; now
he was alone with Andree, whom he loved, who loved
him.... He was alone with her as a man would be alone
with his wife in his home. It was very sweet, wonderful,
and yet he was disquieted. There were things he did not
understand. Chief of all he did not know what Andree
was thinking, what she was intending. Second in importance,
he did not know what he himself was intending....
He put the thought away from him, even though
he realized that their relations had reached some sort of
climax.... He would allow that climax to approach
unurged. When it arrived he would meet it....</p>

<p class='c006'>“The sun puts itself to bed,” Andree said, using the
French locution.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll light the lights,” he replied, and, walking to the
windows, closed the heavy iron shutters and drew the
curtains as the law required him to do before he illuminated
the room. He was glad of something to do to cover
the awkwardness he felt in those first moments.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sit by me,” she said, softly.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was not embarrassed, was, indeed, perfectly normal,
unexcited, at ease; her manner was very gentle, very
sweet. Her every look, every gesture, seemed to declare
her love and her joy in his love. There was a quiet assurance
in her manner; the sure trace of present happiness
which would not tolerate a shadow on this night....
She was her own self, dainty, genuine, wonderfully appealing.
It seemed as if she had lived all her life for this
moment so that she could unfold under the touch of the
marvel of love and become wholly admirable.... She
was beautiful, as was fitting, beautiful with the loveliness
that can come only from a soul not warring with the laws
of God. Untroubled by doubt or question, she reassured
him, gave him renewed confidence in her goodness, her
rightness, her purity.... Her moment of happiness had
come to her, and she looked into the brightness of it with
unwavering eyes that saw nothing to fear, nothing to
conceal—saw only love.</p>

<p class='c006'>He sat beside her and she nestled close to him, touching
his hand, lifting her deep-shadowed eyes to his—and then
she smiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne!</i>” he whispered, tenderly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell me,” she said. “Say it—quickly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I love you,” he responded, and she sighed softly,
closing her eyes, and was silent. So still was she that
he might have fancied her asleep but for the pressure of
her fingers upon his own. After a time she spoke again:</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well—ver’ well—to love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.... But—you are not afraid. Do you remember
the last time you were here you cried? You were
afraid.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have not fear—no. Then I cried because I was not
certain.... I was making up my mind. I have made
up my mind, and so I have no fear.... Oh, I was ver’
<i>solitaire</i>.... But we mus’ not theenk of that now—only
of ourselves. Is it not?... And be happy. We
must be ver’ happy—every little second we must be
happy ... while it lasts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“While it lasts? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing. We mus’ speak of that—not at all. We
mus’ speak only of love and happiness—and of how
sweet is the world and to be alive—together.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It <i>is</i> sweet,” he said, unevenly, moved as he had never
been moved before. “You are sweet ... and <i>good</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doubt, self-accusations, uneasiness, inhibitions, were
swept from him by a flood of tenderness. The world was
right; Andree was right; love was right. Nothing
mattered but Andree and himself. It was their universe,
of which they were masters, with none to forbid. Happiness
was their right; it might not be denied them. The
future was the future, but to-night was to-night, and
little moments of happiness were the gift of Heaven....</p>

<p class='c006'>“You love me?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am here,” she said, simply.</p>

<p class='c006'>His arms were about her, her lips were upon his lips; he
knew his own moment of happiness. “You are here ...”
he whispered. “You are here....”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall Ware had set foot on the French liner
bound for France early in May; he had landed at
Bordeaux, May 19th. It was now the last of June. Less
than two months had passed over his head, but the
Kendall Ware who paced the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne
this evening was years removed from the boy who walked
the decks of the <i>Rochambeau</i> with Maude Knox. He was
altered as only years of experience could have altered
him in the times when men went about their business
after the manner of rational human beings, when death
was not a profession which engaged the world, when the
dollar was the measure of success, when one day was like
another, and meat could be eaten seven days in the week.
The great modification in him was that he had learned
it to be true that man is a thinking animal and that the
brain may be used for something besides adding a column
of figures or as a storage-house for the thoughts of a past
generation. He had perceived that different theories of
life existed in the world. He had been seized by events
and forcibly fed with something which might crystallize
into knowledge, and he had arrived at that unpleasant
junction in the railroad system of life where he must
choose between trains—whether he would board the one
which went ahead swiftly through the Country of Responsible
Individual Thought or the one which lagged
backward through the Land of Swallowed Dogmas....
He was not happy.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was making another discovery—namely, that one
can theorize very comfortably, but that when one transmutes
theory into accomplished fact, theory has become
practice, and speculations upon its results may be exceedingly
unpleasant. Within the last twenty-four hours
Kendall had translated one theory into a fact, and another
fact had arrived, needing no transmutation. The theory
was the little-moment-of-happiness theory, and the fact
was a letter from his mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>That morning after he had left Andree he was rather
disappointed to find that he suffered no remorse, experienced
no sense of having done what he should have left
undone. Andree was Andree, sweet, good, lovable. Because
she was so, and because of his certainty of her cleanness
of soul, he felt no sense of degradation or of having
transgressed. He was even happy, rejoicing, boylike, in
the sweetness of the gift of her love.... He found his
mother’s letter at the office and, having read it, his
romance was smirched with sordidness, its beauty was
dulled by the intrusion of harsh, unsparing, cold convention.
The Middle West had intruded upon Paris, and
he was discovering that there was much Middle West
remaining alive in him.</p>

<p class='c006'>His mother’s letter had said, and he could visualize her
face as she wrote, severe, unyielding, harsh, forbidding:</p>

<p class='c007'>I am sorry to hear that you are stationed in Paris. They say
that Paris is a wicked city. Everybody says the French are
loose and immoral, which makes me worry about all our young
men who are thrown with them. Your letter says that Paris
is beautiful. It is not a good beauty, I have heard. Some one
told me there were statues of naked women all over in the
parks. I cannot understand how they allow such things; they
must be bad, passionate men to allow it. I hope you will be
very careful. You are young, and sometimes you are like your
father, who is easily taken in. I am glad you do not speak
that language, because you cannot get acquainted with French
people. Those women have no morals; they are nasty creatures
who just want to get hold of every penny you get. Some
day you will want to marry a nice, clean American girl, and
you have got to think about that. I don’t see why the war
couldn’t have been some place else. Don’t ever look at one
of them. They’re all atheists and that accounts for it....</p>

<p class='c008'>There was more to the same effect. It reflected his
mother perfectly, and the sentiments of the people among
whom his mother lived; it represented, in extreme terms,
the sentiment of his home community.... And over
against it all stood Andree! That such words should be
used to apply to her was sacrilege!... Yet ... yet ...
she was—no matter what he might argue in her favor—in
the language of his people, Andree was not an honest
woman....</p>

<p class='c006'>The effect of the letter upon him, however, had been
uncanny. While he read he was again in Detroit. His
sensations were almost exactly those which he always
felt as he entered the Presbyterian church with his father
and mother—not as he sat down in the accustomed pew,
but as he passed through the crowded little vestibule
where bald, smug elders and bearded, smug deacons and
severe-faced chairwomen of missionary boards held their
court before the service, shaking hands with all who
entered with that religious affability, that hushed and
somber and severe welcome, which strove to counterfeit
open-heartedness.... It was that vestibule, and not
the church, not the sermon, not the hymns nor the songs,
which personified Kendall’s religion and what his religion
meant.... He had grown up among those elders and
deacons and chairwomen, and he knew them—in the
church. It was incomprehensible to him that they could
have any interests or activities outside the church. The
practice of religion in that place seemed to him to be the
sole occupations of their lives, and when he met one of
them in the secular world of a week-day in the act of
selling goods, or of handling money in a bank, or of anything
else which savored of business and earning a living,
Ken had the sort of feeling one has when he detects a
person in something unusual and a bit discreditable.
Why, those persons <i>were</i> the church!... And the
thoughts of those persons were the thoughts of Kendall’s
home world, thoughts among which he had been raised
from babyhood.... So, as he read, he was transported
to that vestibule—and that vestibule’s occupants smugly
set the stain of guilt upon him and rolled eyes of horror
at Andree.... He had been seeing Paris with something
that approximated the eyes of Paris—now he was seeing
it with the eyes of the vestibule of the Presbyterian
church.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before him stretched the magnificent avenue, crowded,
as dusk descended, with pleasure-seeking Parisians: he
regarded it—regarded it as a spectator, an utter outsider.
It was as if he looked at the scene from a window in the
Presbyterian church. The two worlds stood starkly facing
each other, challenging each other—the civilization
that was Paris and the civilization that had its expression
in the occupants of the church vestibule. Kendall saw,
with something very like to fear, that they could not
be reconciled, that neither contained a starting-point
which would lead to understanding of the other....
And yet he, springing from the one, felt that he understood
both. He was drawn to the one while the other
clung to him tenaciously.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not that his mother’s letter made him feel guilt;
it was rather that it made him feel as if he <i>ought</i> to be
conscious of wrong-doing. He ought to feel wicked and
degraded, but he could not, and the fact that he could
not seemed in itself to convict him of sin.... It was
only when he thought of Andree that any semblance of
stability came upon his thinking. There could be no
argument about Andree. He had studied her, known her,
loved her—and she was good. No church vestibule, no
dogmatic elder, not even his mother, should say Andree
was anything but good. He got some happiness out of
that thought; Andree was an oasis of safety for him.
He was capable of distinguishing between evil and virtue,
he thought, and he had studied Andree as he had never
studied any other living being. From the first moment
of their acquaintance he had not perceived in her one
quality, one emotion, one tendency that was not sweet,
womanly, kindly, lovable, springing from a heart of
purity.... How could a girl, proved to his intelligence
to be good, be otherwise than good? How was it that
any act of hers might be brought into question? Why
was he questioning <i>his</i> righteousness because of his relations
with her when her righteousness because of her
relations with him were not open to question? It was
very confusing. Could two individuals share an act and
one of them be good and the other bad because of it?
That sounded like a violation of some natural law as, for
instance, that two solids cannot occupy the same space
at the same instant.... Or was he wholly wrong?
Could his judgment of her and of Paris and of the whole
French nation be mistaken?... It might even be that
Paris was not beautiful, as he had seen it beautiful, or
that the French nation was not really sturdy, glowing
with virility, heroic, as its deeds had seemed to prove it
to be, but squalid, decadent....</p>

<p class='c006'>He began to walk rapidly, as was his custom when in
mental difficulty, and as he walked he knew the keen
discomfort of a soul in turmoil.... He tried not to
think about it, to put it out of his mind, and to find
pleasure in the evening and in the dusk-softened beauties
of the city, but his mind would not obey. He had a
sensation of being terribly awake, of the blinding glow
as of a tremendously powerful white light inside his head.
His thoughts seemed to function independently of him,
and himself to be an audience present to observe and
listen to their activities. There was something ghastly
about it, something unreal....</p>

<p class='c006'>He strode around the Arc de Triomphe and thence
down the Champs Élysées until he reached the Palais
des Beaux-Arts, and there he turned to his right, crossing
the Pont Alexandre III, marvelously beautiful in the half-light.
He did not pause to admire the river and the
city’s sky-line as he had so often done, but turned again,
this time to his left, and followed the Quai d’Orsay,
clinging to the bank of the Seine until he was opposite
the Cité and in the familiar open space of the Place
St.-Michel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again he turned and followed the broad boulevard up
which he had walked again and again with Andree.
Perhaps that was why he had come to the locality, drawn
subconsciously into a region of such associations. Perhaps
there had been hidden in some recess of his mind
the hope that he might encounter her, and so feel her
presence and sense her goodness and verify his judgment.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the corner of the Boulevard St.-Michel and the
equally broad rue Soufflot is a café whose tables and
chairs crowded the sidewalk. It was still light enough
to distinguish the crowd of people who patronized the
place, sipping coffee from small goblets or drinking wine
or that strange beverage kept in bottles which Paris
believes to be lemonade.... He glanced carelessly at
the café, then he stopped, peered again intently with
a sudden up-leap of the pulse, for at a table near the end
sat a girl in white, wearing a white tam-o’-shanter.
This alone would not have halted Kendall, rather it
would have urged him forward with eager haste, but the
girl was not alone. A man occupied the chair at her side,
bending over her with that eagerness which is not to be
mistaken in a young man, that eagerness which apprises
all the watching world that he is in the act of making
love....</p>

<p class='c006'>At the end of the café were a number of small potted
trees reaching almost to the awning above. Kendall,
unconscious that it was jealousy that dictated his movements,
drew near cautiously to peer over the foliage at
that adjacent table, to assure himself if it were Andree
or not.... It was Andree, and her companion was
Monsieur Robert, of the Comédie Française....</p>

<p class='c006'>Quick suspicion is a natural result of the thing that the
vestibule of the Presbyterian church, as Kendall knew
it, stood for. Intolerance has for its favorite child
Suspicion, Acute Suspicion, which convicts without trial
and, if subsequent trial goes against it, asserts that the
jury was tampered with. It was one of Kendall’s inheritances.
He had been raised under the influence of
constant suspicion. He himself had been suspected; he
was used to seeing the most trivial events suspected.
His mother, for instance, knew instantly that any happening
which came under her eye and about which she was
not fully informed meant something bad. It was never
the way of that body of society in which he had been
brought up to think the best when a trifle of imagination
would enable it to think the worst—and to-night Kendall
was peculiarly under the influence of his inheritances....
He suspected. A natural jealousy deepened his
suspicion. Monsieur Robert’s profession deepened it
further, and Andree’s often stated ambition to become
an actress carried it to more profound depths. Suspicion
may own a specious logic: Andree declared it was necessary
for her to undertake a stage career. To do so it was
necessary to enter the <i>Académie</i>. To enter the <i>Académie</i>
it was necessary to interest the influence of some actor
of prominence, and she had more than once hoped for
this intervention. Ken himself had introduced her to
this Monsieur Robert with that end in view.... And
Jacques, perhaps in jest, perhaps in earnest, had warned him
to beware of Monsieur Robert, or that handsome young
actor would steal Andree from him. Hence Robert must
have that sort of reputation.... And, therefore, Robert
was with Andree at this moment for that purpose....
Again, what more natural and logical than that Andree
should be willing to purchase her career, and that, even
at this very moment, the agreement was being made....
Or, perhaps, had been made before, and he had been
deceived already! Undoubtedly that was it....</p>

<p class='c006'>The part of him inherited from his mother was in
complete control now; he was narrow, certain in suspicion,
hard, willing to be cruel. All that was worst in Roundhead,
Puritan, Pilgrim Father was apparent in him. He
had seen, and, in the instant of seeing, the pendulum of
his character had swung to the uppermost point of its
arc on the side opposed to tolerance, a reasonable philosophy,
and the wider things toward which he had been
growing since he came to France....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother was right,” he said to himself, “they were all
right. I’ve been fooled and I’ve been a fool.... And
I thought she was <i>good!</i>... This damn, miserable
country—if ever I can get out of it back to where decent
people live....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Almost exactly twenty-four hours ago he had held
Andree in his arms, loving her and believing in her love.
He remembered it, recalled the sweetness of last evening,
Andree’s tender sweetness, which could have been nothing
but designing and duplicity.... And now <i>this</i>....
He despised her and he despised himself. A beautiful
dream had become a sordid reality....</p>

<p class='c006'>How much of all this was due to a sudden perception of
right and how much to boyish jealousy and a sharp hurt
to a boyish heart he did not know. It did not occur to
him to ask.... He had been made a fool of. He was
furious with what he took to be righteous anger; what
he did not know was that as soon as she passed there
would come the most poignant grief he had ever known;
the grief that comes only when a beautiful something
has crept into one’s life to be snatched away brutally,
leaving in its nest something squalid, unsightly, disgusting.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a moment he was on the point of confronting
Andree and Monsieur Robert, but he restrained himself.
There would be a scene; probably he would thrash
Robert—and to what good?... He glared at them a
moment longer, then turned away and almost ran down
the boulevard.... He was not thinking now, only
suffering.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently he found himself repeating over and over to
himself: “Andree, how could you?... Andree, how
could you?...” Rage was departing, grief and disillusionment
were taking its place. Presently he came to
a Metro station and plunged downward. The train
would carry him home faster than he could walk, and
he wanted to be home, to shut himself up, to be alone.
He wanted to feel that doors and walls were between him
and all the world.... It was the sort of feeling which,
long continued, drives men into religious orders, makes
of them Trappists, Cistercians.... Shelter and silence
were what Kendall wanted—to crawl away into some
hiding-place where he might make the most of his suffering.</p>

<p class='c006'>He ran up the stairs of the apartment, snatched the
key from under the rug, and threw open the door. The
apartment was lighted. He paused. Madeleine and
Bert were in the <i>salon</i>, and both appeared in the door
to greet him. They called to him gaily, but Kendall did
not reply. He scowled at them and flung himself past
them without a word, to disappear in his room and slam
the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Qu’est-ce que c’est?</i>” exclaimed Madeleine, and then
laughed. “<i>Beaucoup zigzag!</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” said Bert, staring after his friend, “he doesn’t
drink. Something’s up. Something’s happened.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is Andree,” Madeleine said, with a shake of her head.
“I know. <i>Oui....</i> It is plain to read. <i>Jaloux</i>. Oh
yes. I know the signs. <i>Pauvre enfant!</i> He is ver’
jealous. There is no other anger like it—none.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What had I better do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not anything. That is best.... He mus’ be lef’
alone—him.... But I do not theenk—Andree love
heem. I could see. He is not glad.... But what
would you? It is not nice to be jealous. One suffers.
But I theenk he make the mistake—yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anyhow, he’s in an awful stew. Seems like I ought
to do something.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No—he would behave like one <i>sauvage</i>. It is to
make to leave him alone. To-morrow, perhaps....”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Andree glanced at her watch as she emerged from
the Metro at the St.-Michel station that evening
and noticed that it was almost exactly seven o’clock.
With quaint, almost stiff little steps she proceeded across
the Place, her eyes lowered with that charmingly unconscious
demureness which was a part of her, her thoughts
directed inward, as they always seemed to be. She had
a gift of detachment; it was possible for her to be in the
midst of a crowd, and yet to seem and to be unconscious
of the crowd’s proximity or existence. She always seemed
grave, with a tiny hint of apprehension, and when, as she
rarely did, she raised her eyes to regard some passing
individual, it was with a sort of naïve wonder to discover
that there was another human being in her neighborhood....
That is how she impressed one. What she was
really thinking, how much she saw of what went on about
her, nobody ever knew. Kendall, who had studied her
every mood, had not the least idea of what her little
head busied itself with. She was a dainty mystery to
him. She was a dainty mystery to everybody who felt
an interest in her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good evening, Mademoiselle Andree,” said a voice in
her own language, and she looked up with that childishly
startled air which was hers alone. It was Monsieur
Robert, smiling with handsome boyishness and with a
twinkle of mischief in his eye. She regarded him gravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good evening, monsieur,” she replied, timidly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have good fortune,” he said. “I have thought of
you so often; I have wished to meet you, and, behold!
here you are.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She made no reply, but stood looking at him questioningly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is it permitted to say that mademoiselle is very pretty
this evening—as always?... Ah, we were to be friends,
do you remember? It was agreed, was it not? And
some day we were to talk of many things ... of the
<i>Académie</i> and the Comédie and of yourself. Was it not
so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well.” He laughed gaily. “Then shall we talk
this evening? You shall dine with me, then.... It is
impossible that you are much occupied. Fortune could
not be so unkind. You will dine with me and we will
talk of those plans of yours?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She considered a moment unsmilingly, and Monsieur
Robert wondered what were her thoughts. It was impossible
to guess.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, presently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is a café at the corner of the rue Soufflot.
Does that please you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He took his place at her side and they continued up
the boulevard, Andree silent and apparently preoccupied;
Monsieur Robert laughing, gay, exerting all his great
charm and displaying his high abilities in droll humor.
Occasionally Andree looked up at him a moment and
smiled, but for the most part she was serious and gave
what answers were required of her in monosyllables. They
found a table on the sidewalk of the café and gave their
orders.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle desires to enter the <i>Académie</i>?” said he.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not easy to gain admission, which is correct.
It is not every one who is fit.... There are the examinations,
which are difficult.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have not fear of the examinations, for I have studied
very much. It is that—” She hesitated.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That you have not an influential friend to make the
recommendation. Is that it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He laughed easily. “Why do you wish to become an
actress?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I must do something—I must find a career,
because it is necessary to eat. The stage is very well.
I think I can do it; I have always felt I was for the stage.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is very well. One must feel so.... You have
the beauty that appeals, yes. You have the youth.
You have the intelligence, that is clear. Now, if only
you have the talent, the genius—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“One does not know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Until one makes the attempt, it is true.... But I
have a feeling it is there, mademoiselle. Something tells
me so. I am sure of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are very amiable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.... No.... It is but the truth.... But
there is much hard work. In the <i>Académie</i> one must
work until one is ready to drop with fatigue.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is nothing—if one succeeds.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“True.... And the success is very good. Ah,
mademoiselle, I can see the success of you. Behold!...
To-day you are not rich, is it not so? You have no fame.
But the future—what possibilities are there!... You
succeed in entering the <i>Académie</i>. That is possible.
You work, you study, you learn.... The teachers see
that you have beauty, and they search for the talent....
That is their way, and when they see it to be present
they make you work the harder and bestow upon you
the extra pains. Oh yes.... I can see it. Then, with
good fortune, you take the first prize of all the women,
and that makes a place for you on the stage of the Comédie
Française. You shall be a <i>comédienne</i>—that is for you....
And then—one day will come the great success....”
He stopped suddenly and regarded her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can you not see it? To-day you—you are very
charming, but you are merely you. You have nothing,
you are nothing. You have a room, perhaps, for which
you pay seventy francs a month. Am I not right? You
are not happy. You are hidden.... But then comes a
wonderful night. You make the great success. Paris
is at your feet. Paris adores you.... What does it
mean? Ah, mademoiselle, one can scarcely imagine it.
It means a career, a great success in life. It means to be
adored, to have all that a beautiful woman can desire....
It means applause and the envy of all the world—everything!
everything!... What a change! What a
wonderful change!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, her eyes glowing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It means that famous men will compete for your favor.
You will be pointed out everywhere, received everywhere....
The papers will speak of your every movement....
You will be happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then his manner changed, his enthusiasm seemed to die,
and he looked steadily into her face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But before it all comes one must enter the <i>Académie</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle, do you want very much to do so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, greatly! greatly!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then it shall be. I guarantee it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, monsieur!”</p>

<p class='c006'>He leaned over the table, his face serious now, his
handsome eyes eager. “If mademoiselle will be kind,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked at him an instant and let her eyes fall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I love you.... I adore you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” she replied, with the merest hint of a smile.
“It is not so. You do not love me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are very lovely.... You are poor—you shall be
rich. You are unknown—you shall be famous.... And
I love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She did not lift her eyes now, but sat very still and
looked at her plate. Her face told him nothing; it had
not altered its expression of detached gravity—and it
intrigued him, made her the more desirable because
he could not understand her. Her lips quivered, she
closed her eyes and drew a little breath which was almost
a sigh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It cannot be, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He sat erect, astonished, really astonished.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You—you refuse?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You refuse fame and wealth and all that may be
yours?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is necessary, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And why? Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because, monsieur, I love, and I am happy.... I
am faithful.... I am very happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He stared, unbelieving. Then, “It is the American
officer—this Capitaine Ware?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You—you throw it all away for him—for this foreigner?
You throw away your chance—your career?...
It is absurd, impossible!... But look, mademoiselle.
These Americans they do not remain. There is
the war. To-morrow, the next day, he may be ordered
away—he may be sent back to America.... He will
go away from you and leave you lonely.... For a week,
a month, will you throw away your life? Oh, mademoiselle,
think! It would be terrible.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She smiled. “It is the first happiness I have known....
I love him, monsieur, and he loves me. We are very
happy.... Life is not good. It is very bad, but there
may be the little moments of happiness, and they are
most sweet. Does monsieur understand? There may
be grief and loneliness to follow, but those little moments—they
are all of life.... Nothing else is to be considered.
It is as you say.... It may be a week, a month, but I
would not lose it, not for all you promise me.... And
I am constant, I am faithful.... If I must buy my
little moments with this career, then I shall pay—oh, so
happily. Do you not understand? At all events, one
can remember them while life lasts.... They will make
a long life sweet.... And so, monsieur, it cannot be.
I have considered and I have chosen....”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was at this moment, the moment when Andree was
surrendering her future, passing by the call of Fame
and closing her ears to the knock of Opportunity, that
Kendall Ware glared at her above the bushes that shut
in the front of the café.... It was this moment that he
saw—a wonderful, a glowing, a superb moment. He saw
a miracle, and his eyes were shut so that it was not
apparent to him....</p>

<p class='c006'>Monsieur Robert was silent for a space, during which
one might have told the numbers to twenty, and then he
arose, very gravely, dignified now, courtly. He lifted
Andree’s hand and bowed over it and his lips touched it
in token of respect and of honor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle,” he said, quietly, “I have said that
I love you.... It is true.... I have seen a great
thing, a beautiful thing.... I am proud that I have
kissed your hand. From this moment I revere two
women—my mother and yourself....”</p>

<p class='c006'>She smiled up at him with that quaint smile of hers,
that smile which was half lost child, half banished fairy.
“It is nothing ...” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“May I walk on with you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>She shook her head, and then extended her hand.
“Good-by, monsieur,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>He accompanied her to the open walk. “Good-by,
mademoiselle,” he said, softly, and stood looking after
her until she reached the distant Panthéon and turned
the corner. Then he sighed and smiled and shook his
head and walked away. “The women of France!...” he
said aloud, and there was a hushed wonder in his voice.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Despite Bert Stanley’s crudities and carelessness and
boisterousness, he had no mean capacity for friendship.
He was fond of Kendall Ware with that sort of
friendship which one so often finds in men of his character
for others of finer fiber. He did not understand Kendall,
nor did he try overly hard to understand him; it was
enough that he liked him and rather admired him. Sometimes
his attitude toward his friend was of humorous
tolerance. He laughed to himself when Ken took some
slight affair with gravity and seriousness. He thought
Ken was a bit queer and moody. As for himself, he took
things as they presented themselves and made the best
of it, not inquiring into causes and not caring about results
unless there was a possibility of their presenting
themselves in too unpleasant fashion.</p>

<p class='c006'>For instance, he had seen Kendall thrown into somber
mood by a discussion of the unhappy future of hundreds
of thousands of French girls deprived of men with whom
to marry. Of course it did look a bit tough on the women,
Bert thought, but what can you expect? And what
could one do about it? He put this thought into words.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do about it?” Kendall replied, gloomily. “That’s
the devil of it—there’s nothing that can be done about it.
They’re just up against it.... Poor devils!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, it’ll come out all right somehow,” Bert said, with
a shrug. “They’ll find men somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Find men!... There aren’t any men. You can’t
take a stick and whittle out men.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then what in thunder is the use worrying about it?
It’s so, and that’s all there is to it. No use getting
gloomy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But it makes me gloomy. It’s so rotten unfair. It’s
horrible. Just think of what it means to them!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just don’t think about it and you’ll be better off.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was this sort of thing that Bert failed to understand.
He could imagine a man worrying because he was out of a
job, or because he had broken his leg, or because his house
was on fire; but why anybody should go out of his way
to fuss over something that seemed to him like a rather
distant abstraction, he failed to comprehend. But Ken
always did it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert could never understand the effect of the sight of
Paris on his friend. Of course it was a regular city, different
from New York and Chicago, but there was no
use to rave about it or to stand on a bridge mooning and
looking at a row of buildings. Paris meant a good time
of an exotic sort to Bert—and that was all. He was
willing to agree that the town was beautiful if anybody
insisted, but what was the use of insisting? A town was
a town. It wasn’t what a town looked like that made it
a good place to be; it was the business opportunities
of the town and the opportunities for pleasure when
business was over for the day. He went with Kendall
to see Notre Dame, and wondered why in the dickens
anybody had ever gone to the trouble to hew all those
ugly carvings out of stone, or why they should run fringes
of them around a church. It was a sort of dingy old
place, anyhow.... Now for a regular building, give him
the Hôtel de Ville. That was something like, because
it might have been the post-office or a railroad station
in New York. He would have traded his chance to see
all the ramshackle cathedrals in France for one sight of
the Woolworth Building. Now there was something!
There was some use in going to see that structure! It
was capable of astonishing him—but only because it was
so lofty. To see it of a spring morning with the hazy
sun tipping its golden peak meant nothing to him except
looking at a tall building early in the day.... There
wasn’t a high building in Paris! But Ken wanted to
poke around to see such things as Notre Dame, and if he
got pleasure out of it, that was his business.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, Bert saw dimly that Kendall had something
admirable which was denied to him. Not that he
wanted it especially! He was very well satisfied, but
somehow he admired Ken for having it and liked him the
better for it.... And Ken was always philosophizing
about things, and advancing theories, and worrying about
morals, and splitting hairs of right and wrong. To Bert
certain things were wrong, and the rest didn’t matter.
It was wrong to murder and to steal or to kick a child
or to cheat at cards or in any other game. As for the
bulk of the rest of the possible acts of man, he saw them
as neuter, and not mattering much.... But Ken could
get up a moral argument over the way he spread his bread!
And these arguments had the power to upset his friend
completely, to make him gloomy, to worry him.... It
was utter nonsense, but it was a part of Ken and Ken
was his friend.</p>

<p class='c006'>He felt a sort of duty to look after Ken, a responsibility
for him. He was actually troubled sometimes by one of
Ken’s moods and deliberately thought up means to cheer
him.... And now he was really worried. He had
never seen Kendall as he had appeared last night. Something
out of the ordinary had happened. Most likely it
was nothing that the ordinary fellow would think twice
about, but the Lord only knew how it would affect Ken.
Anyhow, Ken thought he was in some sort of trouble, and
Bert was really disturbed. He had wanted to do something
about it last night, but Madeleine had prevented,
and now he felt rather guilty. Putting on his bathrobe
and slippers, he went to Ken’s door and opened it
softly. Ken was sitting up in bed, staring out of the
window.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Morning,” said Bert, affably.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Morning,” replied Kendall, shortly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Um!... Cheerful, ain’t you? Say, what’s eating
you, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing, my aunt’s knee-cap! Come through.
What’s carried off your goat?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall did not reply.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Get up and have breakfast. I hear Arlette in the
kitchen. You’ll feel better after you’ve had a bowl of
chocolate warming up your tummy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t want any breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Huh?...” Bert was beginning now to be seriously
troubled. “Say, what’s the matter, anyhow? Is it
Andree?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve just been a damn fool, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ought to be used to it,” said Bert, flippantly, and
then, more seriously, “Say, you don’t mean to say that
you’ve gone and went and fallen in love with her, or
anything like that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look here,” Ken said, morosely, “I don’t want to
talk about it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do,” said Bert, with a grin, “so we’re going to talk.
I’m the biggest, and I can doggone well hold you while
we thrash it out. Now tell it to your uncle. Are you
in love with Andree?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That means you are.... What about it? Say,
you don’t mean you’re worrying about <i>marrying</i> her,
do you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken laughed unpleasantly. “I wouldn’t marry her if
she was the last woman on earth. I never want to see
her again. I never want to think about her again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Huh! Had a row, eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert glowered at his friend a minute. “I don’t know
whether you are interested or not, but you give me an
acute pain. Why in blazes can’t you go along and have
a good time like a fellow ought to without always landing
into the middle of something that fusses you all up?
You think too darn much.... Now there’s Madeleine
and I—you don’t see me doing any worrying or scrapping,
do you? Well!... Nor falling in love. You bet you
don’t! When I fall in love it will be with some American
girl, and then I’ll settle down and raise a family and wear
slippers in the evening. But now I’m out to have what
fun is going before I get my style cramped. I like
Madeleine and she likes me.... That’s all. I’m giving
her a good time, and she’s a good fellow—but that’s all
there is to it. She knows it and I know it, and there you
are. I saw to that right at the start-off. I told her. You
bet I did! I said to her, ‘Now look here, young lady,
we’re just playing, understand. There’s nothing serious
about this. I’m going back to America some day, and
when I do, it’s good-by.’ And she feels the same way
about it.... And that’s the only system.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette came shuffling into the room after Kendall’s
shoes and responded to Bert’s greeting with a grin and
a bob of her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arlette,” said Bert, “Monsieur Ken’s in love. You’ve
had experience, eh? What’s to be done about it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eh?... In love!... <i>Mon Dieu!</i> What does one
do about it? One makes nothing. Either one is in love
or one is not.... I have been in love.” She wagged
her head sagely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I knew it. I could tell it just by looking at you.
What did you do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I married ... and now I have grandchildren, and
love is no more for me.... But I remember it, messieurs....
Yes, yes, I often think of it. Is that not droll?”
Again she waggled her head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But Monsieur Ken is in love and he doesn’t seem
to like it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It happens so,” she said. “There is both joy and
sorrow. But monsieur is loved in return. I have perceived
it. Why, then, is he not joyous?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You tell the answer. I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He loves Mademoiselle Andree; Mademoiselle Andree
loves him. She is very pretty, very sweet.... Well,
then?” She made a gesture with her arms as if to say
that the thing was beyond human comprehension.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All the Americans are mad,” said Bert in French,
employing the phrase of the streets.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is true,” said Arlette, nodding. “I have seen it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And when they are in love they are madder than ever.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It may well be believed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, get out and leave me alone, both of you,” Ken
said, morosely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing of the sort. Explain carefully the difficulty
to Arlette and me. We are the council of experts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s nothing—except that I was a fool to get mixed up
in this kind of a thing. It’s rotten.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s his conscience, Arlette,” said Bert, with mock
impressiveness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When the conscience makes to interfere in a matter
of love,” said Arlette, “it means either that one is not
in love at all or that one is jealous. Love, messieurs, is
its own conscience.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Madeleine said you were jealous last night. Two
experts agree.... Jealous! Um!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m not jealous, you gibbering idiot. I—It’s just that
I thought Andree was something and find she’s not....
It’s the whole idea over here. I thought it was right—and
it’s rotten. I was losing my balance. I thought
wrong could be right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It never can be when the other fellow does it,” said
Bert, with more acuteness than usual. “Then you’re
not worrying about marrying Andree? And you have
discovered that you’re being very wicked, and so you’re
in the dumps, and you’re figuring on calling the whole
thing off and living a noble and austere life. Huh!...
What happened last night? You can’t fool your uncle.
You got a letter from home, and then something happened.
What was it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I saw Andree with that actor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” exclaimed Arlette, and she passed off, as
though frightened, to her kitchen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You saw them together? Where?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In a café?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes—go on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you—Oh, say—all this cat-fit is because you
saw Andree in a café with another man! Get out!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“With that particular man. You know what Jacques
said about him.... You know Andree wants to get
into the <i>Conservatoire</i> and on the stage. I introduced
them—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“More fool you,” said Bert, succinctly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was plain enough. She could use him. She
needed his influence—so—Oh, what’s the use? I don’t
want to talk about it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert thought that Ken’s view was altogether likely.
And why not? But he conceived it to be his duty to
argue against it in his friend’s interest. “Just a case of
plain, or garden, jealousy. Nothing to it. You see them
together in a café and jump to conclusions. Didn’t hang
around to see where they went?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Made up your mind with a snap—and then, because
you were jealous, and it looked as if your nose was out
of joint, you hollered sour grapes. In a second it all
got to be immoral and naughty—and you’re worked up
to a state of mind.... If this actor had never come
along, and if Andree had loved you alone and all that,
would it have been wrong?... Of course not, and you
know it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken did not reply, but he had an uncomfortable feeling
that Bert was right.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’d better give her a chance to explain—or did
you burst in on the party and rear and tear all over the
place?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They never knew I saw them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, old son, you’d better let Andree tell you about
it. Madeleine says she loves you and Arlette says she
loves you—and, believe me, they’re experts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If she loves me, and then would do such a thing, it’s
all the worse.... I’ll never see her again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, if your mind’s made up, there’s the end of the
whole thing. Get up and eat and forget it.... The
river’s full of fish.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t think I’d try it again. Never!... I’ve
been a fool, and a rotten fool.... I fooled myself into
thinking one could do this kind of thing and not be wrong.
I got it into my head that our ideas of morals in America
were old-fashioned and narrow and absurd, and that the
French were right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course you’d have to philosophize about it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I’m through now. I’ve got what was coming
to me—and right on top of it there was a letter from
mother.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll bet I know the kind. I’ve stayed at your house,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you think—” Ken bit his lips and stopped.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, and I’m not going to. I’m satisfied. What’s the
use wasting energy thinking when it doesn’t earn you
anything? You got a jolt and a sermon, and between them
they’ve given you a mental twister.... After we’ve
walked down to the office you’ll feel better, son.... Get
up before I haul you out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall got heavily out of bed while Bert returned
to his own room to dress. When one is Kendall Ware’s
age the morning should be the pleasantest part of the day,
and usually it is so. One does not arise weary and irritable,
but joyously, looking forward to the day that is coming....
This morning Ken left his bed like a man of sixty
whose digestion has become the primary consideration of
his life, and who is not fit to enter human society before
noon. He had not slept well, his head was heavy—and
he despised himself. At any rate, he fancied he despised
himself, which makes for the same result. There was the
sharp grief of youth as well, and one does not wisely who
belittles the griefs of youth. It seems to be true that
the energies which make youth wonderful give of their
strength to the pain that youth can feel.... Now he
was certain he had loved Andree and he had never experienced
anything that compared with the distress and
chagrin at his discovery that he had loved an unworthy
object. He had idealized Andree, had made of her something
more than human, something above the laws of
humanity, mystic, of the stuff of which fairies are made,
and she had been proved dross and himself a self-deluded
fool.... He was bitter against himself and her. His
thoughts made him well worthy to accept a high place in
the company of those who gathered in the vestibule of his
church at home....</p>

<p class='c006'>He approached the table without appetite, and Arlette,
when she brought in the pitcher of chocolate, eyed him
sidewise and askance, and waddled out, shaking her head
uneasily. He could hear her muttering to herself, and it
annoyed him, because he knew she was troubled about
him. Bert had chosen to leave him alone and to let the
thing run its course, so the breakfast was a silent one.
They put on their overseas caps and descended the stairs
without a word.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the passageway the <i>concierge</i> was waiting for them
with the friendly smile which had always made his returnings
to the apartment seem more like homecomings.
She rested on her broom and wished them good morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your national <i>fête</i> is but a few days away,” she said.
“It is made a national <i>fête</i> for us also—this fourth day of
July. All Paris—all France will make it a day the like
of which has not been seen. I hear this on all sides....
It is a pleasure to me to have American officers in this
house. I am envied. I speak only the truth. Therefore
I hope messieurs the American officers will procure for
me flags of their country to hang from their windows.
It will be an honor. Will messieurs see to this matter?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, indeed,” said Bert. “I’ll get them for you
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Many thanks,” she said, and returned to her sweeping.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nice old lady,” said Bert. “They’re all nice. Cordial
lot—these French people.... I wonder how we would
act in America if we had a couple of millions of foreign
soldiers planted down on us. Mostly we’re disagreeable
to strangers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken did not answer. He was staring straight before
him and thinking, thinking, thinking. His thoughts were
intolerant thoughts, uncharitable, narrow. It was of
thoughts such as his, persisted in until they become
habitual, that are born the hanging of witches and the
burning of martyrs.... They were not natural to him,
and they filled him with discomfort and restlessness. He
had a vague sense that he was being not altogether fair,
and that he was condemning the whole because of a fault
in a part. All France must not necessarily be evil because
Andree had proved to be faithless, but he was declaring it
to be evil. There was no good in it; there was no good in
anything except the ruthless bigotry which had taken
possession of him. There was no God but Puritanism, and
Narrowness was its prophet....</p>

<p class='c006'>They reached the Élysées Palace Hotel in which were
their offices. He had not enjoyed his walk; there had
been none of that pleasure which always before he derived
from the great open stretches and wide boulevards of
Paris. Beauty had ceased to exist or to signify.... He
had a sensation of being shriveled up and dried—of lifelessness,
and his thoughts seemed to rub against one
another like sand-paper.... He saw it all as the unpleasant
process of a moral awakening; it was not that;
it was the disgruntlement of a youth over a love-affair
gone awry....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hope it wears off during the day,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken only grunted, and turned up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a futile day and he was glad when it came to an
end. It was not until he was hanging his cap on the hall
tree that he remembered Andree was to come—to come
there to dine this evening. He paused with hand in mid-air
as he recalled how they had made the plan. Hereafter
she was not to meet him at the Metro, but would come
directly to the apartment. It would be better, and there
was something exquisitely attractive about it. He had
been very happy. Her lips had been close to his as
she had given her promise to come there to him; the
perfume of her had been in his nostrils, and in that
maddening way of perfumes it returned now unasked and
undesired. It was almost as if she were there, close to
him, but invisible. He remembered that she had lain in
his arms at the moment, smiling, sweet, a marvelous
creature to be treasured with a great tenderness.... And
she had gone from that to a meeting with another man—to
purchase material success at the price of spurious
love!...</p>

<p class='c006'>What should he do? He did not want to see her, felt
that he could not undergo the ordeal of seeing her....
He snatched his cap and turned to the door, only to replace
it again on the hall tree and to stand wavering, undecided....
He did not know it, would not admit it, but his
heart cried out to see her, to feel the delight of her presence....
He despised her, but he loved her.... As
one does at such moments, he sought refuge in sophistry.
It was necessary for him to see her this last single time.
He must tell her that he had detected her infamy and, with
harsh words, cast her out of his life. He told himself
that this was both appropriate and essential.... Yes,
he would allow her to come and would admit her—and
then—and then she should hear the truth, the bald truth.
She should hear what a decent man thought of such
behavior as hers.... Not that it would benefit her or
change a character that could be guilty of the thing of
which she was guilty.... But he had to accuse her....
It was the desire, the cruel desire, which comes to
every man at some moment, for some cause, to inflict
agony on the one he most loves....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall glanced at his watch. It wanted fifteen
minutes to seven, the hour at which Andree would arrive,
so he went into the <i>salon</i>, there to pace up and down,
restlessly composing dignified but biting speeches one
after the other and forgetting them as soon as composed....
Bert entered and spoke to him, but Kendall only
growled, and Bert passed into his own room with a shrug.
From the door to the window Kendall paced, and from
the window to the door, to and fro, with rapid, excited
stride. As the moment of Andree’s arrival neared, his
thoughts became less coherent and himself more apprehensive.
He felt that it was his duty to be very angry,
so he worked himself up to anger.... Then came a soft,
timid rap at the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>He strode into the hall and flung the door open savagely.
There stood Andree, fragile, lovely, appealing, her face
turned up to his with that wistful question which it
always wore when they first met. She looked so dainty,
so small, so sweet!... Her eyes met his and waited a
moment for his smile of welcome before they smiled.
Always she seemed to be afraid—afraid that she would
not read welcome in his eyes. He remembered it, and
her look accused him. He stood silent, staring. Her
lips parted at the strangeness of his manner and he saw
astonishment grow in her dark-shaded eyes.... He
found the rage up to which he had worked himself slipping
away from him; as he looked down at her it even seemed
impossible to believe that she was not all he had thought
her to be. There was an innocence, a trustfulness about
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come in, mademoiselle,” he said, coldly, stepping
back to permit her to pass.</p>

<p class='c006'>She entered slowly, diffidently. He could see that she
was surprised, hurt by his manner, and a feeling of guilt
overtook him. She stopped near him and turned expectantly....
He understood. He was expected to act
the lover; she was awaiting his lover-like greeting....
He discovered how much bolder and more resolute one
may be in anticipation than at the required moment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do not take off your things,” he said, striving to keep
his voice steady and emotionless. “Will you come in
here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She obeyed silently, with a silence that came from sudden
apprehension. He followed her and stood before her,
searching for words with which to begin, and she, her
face grave and a little sad, as was its custom, stood very
still, but once or twice her eyes turned upward quickly
to read his face. The speeches he had prepared against
this moment had hidden themselves away, and he was
left with an uncomfortable feeling of inadequacy to the
event. He hesitated; the silence became unsupportable,
and he began with sudden harshness, a harshness that a
little frightened himself when he heard it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never intended to see you again,” he said, “but I
forgot you were coming here to-night.” He spoke in
English, rapidly, but she understood him, for her eyes
lifted now and remained fixed on his own, dark, frightened,
appealing. He looked into them and turned hastily away.
There was a magic in them that he feared; they seemed
so pure, so honest.... Her lips parted a little, but she
did not speak.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I loved you,” he said, hoarsely, “and I trusted you....
I thought you were good and honest. I trusted you,
do you understand? Trusted you and believed in you.”
Words were coming more easily now, and with facility in
speech returned what he fancied to be his righteous anger.
“I was a fool.... I thought that you, even brought up
in this city, in this way of life, could be good and faithful....
You fooled me—I should have known better. It
was my own fault.... But I’ve got my lesson. I’ve
seen. I know now.... I loved you—I was all ready to
love you—but I despise you.... Do you understand?
I despise you. You are bad—bad. You said you loved
me and you gave me your love—and it was all a lie....
How many other men are you telling the same thing?
Is every day given to somebody?” He was bitter now,
cruelly bitter.</p>

<p class='c006'>She did not speak, but stared up at him as though
she did not believe, at least as if she did not understand.
Her face was pitiful in its surprise and pain. Motionless,
without movement or gesture, she stood and looked up
into his face as a dog might look into the face of his
master, knowing that master is about to shoot him to
death.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never want to see you again. I want to forget you.
I wish I could forget that I ever saw you and all that has
happened. Probably it doesn’t matter to you. Maybe
you don’t see any harm in what you’ve done—but it was
squalid and contemptible.”</p>

<p class='c006'>His voice rose with his anger and she shrank back from
him. Bert, startled, came hurrying into the room and
stopped with amazement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ken,” he exclaimed, “easy ... easy. What’s all this?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Please go away, Bert.... I’m telling her what I
think of her.... Go away.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert looked curiously at Andree, who did not move her
eyes from Kendall’s face, and then he shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No need to shout,” he said. “You’re excited, old
man.” He turned to Andree. “You mustn’t mind him.
He’s wrought up about something.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree did not appear to notice that Bert was present.</p>

<p class='c006'>He laid his hand on Kendall’s arm. “Come along,” he
said. “Don’t say something you’ll be sorry for.... If
you want Andree to go away, I’ll take her.... Come
on into your room.” He was really apprehensive, for
Kendall’s eyes glowed somberly, his face was convulsed
with toxic emotion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken shook off his friend’s hand. “Leave me be....
This is my affair.” He pointed to the door. “Go!...”
he said to Andree, his voice quivering. “You don’t know
what you’ve done—what miserable thing you’ve done....
I despise you.... I despise you....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert stepped forward and touched her arm. “You’d
better go, I guess,” he said in a low tone. “Ken’s pretty
excited. Let me take you down.” His voice was
sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree did not move. “Oh, I do not onderstan’....
I do not onderstan’ ...” she said, like a frightened
child.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t lie,” said Kendall, furiously. “Go!... And
never come back.... I’ll never see you again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She stood an instant more, her eyes seeking his, demanding
of his. Then, very slowly, very quietly, without
sob or even a quiver of her dainty lips, she turned and
walked to the door. There she paused and turned to
look at him again, rather drooping, hopeless, appealing....
“Oh, it is not well.... I do not onderstan’,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall turned his back.... In another instant the
door had opened and closed and Andree was gone.
He stood with hands clenched, experiencing a certain
unholy satisfaction. He had done the thing thoroughly.
He had finished it. He had told her what he thought of
her, and he was rid of her forever.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently Bert returned. He walked up to his friend
with a grim look upon his usually nonchalant face. “That
was pretty average brutal,” he said. “Maybe it’s good
Presbyterian to do that sort of thing.... If it is, I
thank God I’m a heathen.... That poor little kid! Did
you see her face?...”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Arlette stood in the dining-room door, making her
silent announcement that dinner was served. Her
round eyes, which usually wore an expression of surprise,
were now frightened, and she stared at Kendall as if he
were some sort of explosive that was likely to go off at
any moment with a tremendous explosion. Then she
withdrew her head and could be heard padding out to the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on,” said Bert. “Dinner’s on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t want any dinner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t deserve any dinner,” said Bert, hotly,
“but you’ve got to eat.” He pushed Ken toward the
dining-room. “In with you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall obeyed apathetically, took his chair and began
to eat automatically, without interest in his food. He
had anticipated a sort of barbarous pleasure from his
harshness toward Andree, but found it ashes in his mouth.
He was ashamed of himself, and then ashamed of himself
again for being ashamed. He had done right, exactly
right, he insisted. She had deserved what he had given
her, but nevertheless he was ashamed of himself. There
are two identities in every man, the emotional, the sentimental,
the natural—and the intellectual. Either of
these identities may perform actions satisfactory to itself
but abhorrent to the other. Kendall’s intellectual
and logical self was content; his emotional self accused
him.... If one would be happy, if he would gain and
retain affection, if he would have the best gifts of life for
himself and those with whom he comes in contact, he
should place confidence in his emotional self rather than
his intellectual. The emotions are natural and for the
most part kindly. They do not operate by rule and
precept, but spontaneously; intellect is artificial and logic
is without the warmth of life.... Even the law recognizes
a distinction, for it does not punish a crime of
emotion with the severity that it metes out to the crime
of cold reason. Peter was emotional, he denied his
Master, yet was forgiven and stands chief of the companions
of Christ; Judas took logical thought and betrayed.
He committed the unforgivable sin. The difference
was not so much in kind as in cause....</p>

<p class='c006'>“What would you have done?” he demanded, suddenly,
of Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wouldn’t have been so infernally brutal.... You
and I have been friends a long time, haven’t we?...
Well, right now I’m nearer to wanting to give you a
thrashing than I thought I could ever come. It was
rotten!... Poor kid!... And the way she took it!
Without a word or a whimper!... But did you see her
face?... I came darn near blubbing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She deserved it.... She did. She did a rotten thing—and
anybody would think it was I who was to blame.
I won’t be put in the wrong.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m not going to quarrel with you. You asked me
what I thought, and I told you.... I wouldn’t have
the confounded conscience you have to live with for a
million dollars. I’m no angel. I suppose I do a lot of
things the righteous folks back home would think were
pretty bad. I’m not much on religion, either. But,
all the same, if there is a God, I’ll bet He’s a lot more
apt to take a liking to the fellow who is a bit off color,
but tries to be sort of kind and tolerant, and not to hurt
folks, than He is to the man who lives up to every letter
and punctuation mark of the law, and does it like a brute....
From what I’ve seen of you stiff-necked, righteous
folks, if I were God I’d be pretty average sore to think
I had to have heaven crowded with you. You’d irritate
me till I let in a bunch of sinners just to get some decent
company....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Right is right and wrong is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Huh!... Maybe! But who knows what is right
and what is wrong? It’s a guess, and everybody does
his own guessing.... There are your Ten Commandments,
sure enough, but you can’t regulate the whole
world and all it does with ten little rules.... Let’s see!
Wasn’t there an eleventh commandment later on? I
used to go to Sunday-school myself. Something to the
effect that you ought to love your neighbor as yourself?
A God that could make that sort of a commandment
isn’t going to be too stiff-backed about the other ten.
No, sir.... Things are too mixed up for <i>anything</i> to be
all wrong or all right. Everything’s a mixture—and the
more of that love-your-neighbor stuff there is in it, why,
my notion is, the nearer it is to what is really good.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken was surprised. He had never accused Bert of so
much abstract speculation, and perhaps Bert had not been
speculating consciously before. It was rather that these
ideas had been taking root in him and growing spontaneously.
Possibly Bert was himself astonished to find
himself uttering such ideas.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s over now,” Bert said, presently, “so let’s shut up
about it. You’re in a devil of a state of mind, and the
only thing to get rid of <i>that</i> is to walk it off. As soon as
I finish this cheese I’m going to take you out and walk
you till you’re human again—or till you drop.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll walk.... I’ll do anything. I want to get outdoors
and move.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on, then, sonny, but be genial—be genial. It’s
a walk we’re going for, not a march to the grave.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked over to the rue du Faubourg St.-Honoré,
which presented to them a face of little second-class shops,
dairy products, bakeries, locksmiths, antiques, wine-shops,
variety-stores, in front of every second one of which was
its cat—a huge, sleek Thomas or a matronly old Tabby
keeping an eye on two or three adventurous kittens. The
street seemed to have a special leaning toward the feline
in pets. But, then, all Paris is a sanctuary for cats, which
is remarkable when one takes into account the number of
dogs, and even jackals and young foxes, the latter affected
by the ladies. It may be that there is a permanent
truce between the dogs and cats in Paris. Bert remarked
that he had never seen a cat chased by a dog there.
Possibly, he declared, it might be the system. American
dogs chased cats. It was their moral code to do so;
Parisian dogs left cats alone, for a similar reason.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s all a matter of where you live,” he said, in an
effort to arouse Kendall. “Maybe there’s a place in the
world where they put deacons in jail and look up reverently
to burglars. You can’t tell. I suppose folks could agree
among themselves to almost anything.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Except to alter a natural law,” said Ken, harshly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Natural law, eh? What’s a natural law? To be
sure, I get you. The shortest distance between two points,
and gravitation, and that sort of thing. I guess nobody
could change them, but, so far as I can see, they’re the
only settled things in the world. Natural laws—pretty
good name for them. Means they come right from
nature without people’s tinkering with them at all,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s the kind of law for me—the sort you can’t
disobey and so get in wrong.... But the other
kind—what’ll we call ’em—that’s something else again, Mawrus.
The kind of law that has to be agreed upon by a majority
before it goes to work isn’t such a serious matter in the
long run. I mean, it is important only to the majority
that agrees on it. Some other majority in the next
county might agree to its exact opposite. Like local
option. It’s a sin to sell liquor on one side of a fence and
a legitimate business on the other.... Huh!... I
never got to thinking how funny it all was before.”</p>

<p class='c006'>How curious it was, thought Kendall, with quickened
interest, that Bert should rather clumsily be following a
line of reasoning that he himself had followed with deeper
study and more particularity during the past weeks!...
Could there really be something in it, after all? He had
been sure of it yesterday, but yesterday was gone forever,
and that had happened since which made the affairs and
reasonings of yesterday repulsive to him.... But—the
dogmatism, the harsh, uncompromising, puritanical
attitude he had chosen to take quivered a very little on its
foundations....</p>

<p class='c006'>They proceeded onward past the Ministry of the
Interior on their left, and on their right the building with
its great central court, and its archway through which
could be seen broad, red-carpeted steps, which was the
French White House—the residence of France’s President.
Now small cafés and wine-shops became more numerous,
and the shops to partake of a better quality.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hey!” said Bert, stopping, “want to introduce you
to a friend.” He stepped into a little wine-shop and
spoke to the young woman behind the bar, who lifted
her voice loudly, calling a name that Kendall could not
catch. In a moment a rather dirty, but very bright-eyed,
bull-terrier appeared from the rear and stood looking at
Bert expectantly. Bert selected a copper from his
pocket and put it in the dog’s mouth. The creature
waggled his tail violently and trotted out into the
street.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Watch him,” Bert urged.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dog trotted into the adjoining baker’s shop,
barked once sharply with a note of command. A young
woman leaned far over the counter, holding out her hand,
into which the dog dropped his coin and stood expectant
while she selected a roll and handed it to him. Then, in
the most dignified manner, he paced back to Bert, waggled
his tail in thanks, waited to be patted, and withdrew
under a table to eat his dainty.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There!” said Bert. “Finest dog in Paris. Wish I
could buy him. Say, wasn’t that great?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Huh!...” grunted Kendall, rather astonished that
anybody could be interested in dogs when the world was
coming down in awful ruin as his world was coming down.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert was offended. To him that dog was one of the
sights of Paris, and, when he returned to America, it
would be that animal and his little piece of cleverness
that he would describe rather than anything else he had
seen in Paris. The dog was worth coming to see....
Notre Dame was just a dingy pile of stones.... Yet,
somewhere in him was a strain that was able to speculate
on the attitude of God toward Pharisees and sinners....</p>

<p class='c006'>They continued in silence until they reached the
Place du Théâtre Français, with the Palais Royal before
them and the Comédie Française, and with the magnificent
breadth of the Avenue de l’Opéra angling sharply to the
left. Across the open space was the University Union,
and Bert suggested dropping in to see if any acquaintances
were lounging about, when suddenly they were hailed
from a distance, and, turning, saw Jacques, wooden leg
grotesquely swinging at an angle from his body, hat
swinging about his head, and cane describing enthusiastic
circles. Jacques was trying to run to catch them. His
method was to take two hops with his sound leg and then
one lurch with the artificial one. There was a devil-may-care
jauntiness about this unusual gait and a good-fellowship
about his eccentric salutations that, somehow,
always gained him a welcome.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah,” he shouted, when yet he was thirty feet away,
“I have find you! I have surround you—eh? Where
’ave you been? I have not seen you for <i>longtemps</i>....
And Monsieur Kendall. It ees well. We are friends and
<i>camarades</i>.... I have speak about you thees evening—you,
Monsieur Kendall. Ho! you have the great good
fortune, <i>n’est-ce pas</i>? I give you my felicitations. I
salute you.... Ah, messieurs, eet was <i>magnifique,
splendide</i>!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What was magnificent, Jacques? Take a breath and
start in fresh,” Bert admonished.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jacques patted Ken on the back. “Oh, he ees a good
boy, thees Monsieur Kendall. He deserve the good fortune,
<i>mais</i>, messieurs, it ees of a grandeur. Again I make
the congratulations.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why? Why? Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bicause,” said Jacques, becoming preternaturally
solemn, “bicause monsieur ees loved.” He paused. “<i>Oui</i>,
he ees loved ver’ well by beautiful yo’ng girl who ees ver’
<i>fidèle</i>. It ees one beautiful theeng. I make to weep
w’en it ees tol’ to me. <i>Vraiment!</i> The tear she stand in
my eyes. <i>Sacré nom d’une pipe!</i> but it ees the theme for a
poem.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What in thunder are you talking about? Light on a
bough, little bird, light.” Bert grasped Jacques by the
shoulder and pretended to hold him down to earth.
“Now, little man, come clean. Tell the story and don’t
bubble over.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It ees the leetle sweetheart of Monsieur Kendall—thees
so graceful and beautiful yo’ng girl that has for her
name Andree. She weesh for enter into the <i>Académie</i> and
<i>après</i> to be an actress. It is so.... To do this is ver’
<i>difficile</i>. It is necessary first to have much influence.
Monsieur Kendall know thees. Yes. <i>Alors</i>, Monsieur
Kendall introduce thees yo’ng girl to Monsieur Robert.
I am present and see. Also I warn monsieur that thees
Robert loves all young girl.... What would you? The
theeng befalls yesterday. As Monsieur Robert emerges
from the Metro near the Place St.-Michel he see bifore
him thees Mademoiselle Andree, walking weeth her eyes
so careful upon the sidewalk—so.” Jacques imitated
Andree’s demure glance. “She do not see Robert until he
address her. She is startle’—ver’ much startle’, but
Monsieur Robert he is polite, <i>oui</i>, he is <i>très-gentil</i>. He
ask mademoiselle will she promenade weeth heem, and
she cannot refuse. Next he ask will she dine weeth heem,
and she ees too sweet and gentle to hurt hees feeling, so
she consent....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert felt Kendall grasp his arm with fingers that
gripped to the bone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then they eat, this Mademoiselle Andree and Monsieur
Robert, and he say to her if she will be kind to
heem he make her to enter into the <i>Académie</i>, and give
her hees influence, which is much, that she bicome a
success, weeth all Paris at her feet.... It was wonderful
chance for poor yo’ng girl, <i>n’est-ce pas</i>? One million girl
they jump at it. Truly.... But thees mademoiselle she
shake her head and say no—and why, messieurs?...
Bicause she love thees yo’ng man here ver’ true and is
<i>fidèle</i>. It ees the truth, and it ees ver’ beautiful....
Monsieur Robert say thees yo’ng man make himself to go
away and leave her <i>solitaire</i>. Mademoiselle makes to him
the reply that it does not matter—for weeth Monsieur
Kendall she have the wonderful little moment of happiness
w’ich is more splendid, more magnificent, more to be
desired than any other theeng in the worl’ ... bicause
it ees the great love.... Yes, she say thees theeng to
Robert, who admire so much he kees her hand, and now he
tells me and others, and as he tell the tear stands in his
eyes. He theenk Mademoiselle Andree she has make the
great success, to which nothing can compare, a success
much times greater than fame or than glory—bicause
it is a success of the soul.... So I make many compliments
to Monsieur Kendall—many compliments....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert ...” said Ken, in a voice that was little more
than a whisper. “Bert....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ees monsieur ill?” asked Jacques.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, Jacques. Just out of sorts—worried,” said Bert.
“I’m walking it out of him.... Mighty glad to have
met you, old man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall turned to Jacques. “What you say about
Andree—is it true? You are sure?...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Certainement</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course,” Ken answered, slowly. “I didn’t doubt
it.... It sounded like the truth.... I thank you,
Jacques. Some day I’ll thank you better.” He held
out his hand. “Good night, Jacques.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He turned away, and Bert, after shaking hands with
the exuberant little Frenchman, followed. Jacques stood
for a moment staring after them, then waved his cane in the
air for no purpose whatever, and said, perplexedly, “<i>Tous
les Américains sont fous....</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken walked rapidly, as one in haste to reach a definite
destination; he did not speak. Bert, keeping pace with
him, watched his friend’s face covertly; it was a gray
mask without expression, a mask that seemed to tell a
tale of years double that which made the total of Kendall’s
life.</p>

<p class='c006'>They diagonaled across the Place Marengo and at a
more acute angle through the Place du Louvre to the
Quai du Louvre and crossed the Pont Neuf, which
carried them over the broader arm of the Seine, the
upper point of the Cité, where to their left arose the
dark mass of the Palais de Justice, and across the narrower
branch of the river to the Quai des Augustins.
Presently the Place St.-Michel opened before them,
and, as Kendall turned into it Bert stopped to demand
where they were going.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To find her,” said Kendall.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert nodded. “I thought so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was like Kendall—to start upon a search for her
immediately. Just as jealousy, made more vicious by
an attack of Puritan conscience, had caused him to drive
Andree out of his life, so now that same conscience demanded
that immediate reparation be made. If Bert
knew his friend, then Kendall would be unable to rest
until he had seen Andree, until he had debased himself
before her and begged her forgiveness....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Does she live here?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Near the Panthéon some place.... I don’t know.
I haven’t her address.... Bert, I don’t even know her
last name!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eh? What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know her name.... Somehow that was a
part of it—the mystery—not knowing. It—I can’t
explain it to you—but she seemed like something dainty
and lovely that appeared out of nothingness. I never
asked, because I didn’t want to know. She appeared and
disappeared—like a fairy.... It was as if she were immaterial
and only materialized herself for me—do you
understand?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m darned if I do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I always left her a little ways beyond—on the rue
Soufflot. She went on alone toward the Panthéon.
That’s all I know. Just that her name was Andree—and
that she could appear and disappear. It was that unreality
that made the whole thing possible.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A few practical details would make the whole thing
a lot more possible now.... What do you aim to do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait for her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Huh!... Where?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At the corner of the rue Soufflot.... She may pass
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And she may not pass for a month.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I’ll wait a month,” said Kendall, and Bert
knew that his friend meant what he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked on up the boulevard and took seats at a
table in that very café where Kendall had seen Andree
and Monsieur Robert the night before. He could see that
table, occupied now by a <i>poilu</i> and his sweetheart....
Bert ordered coffee for them, which came in thick glasses
accompanied by a bottle of <i>saccharin</i> for the sweetening.
Kendall left his glass untouched while his eyes fixed
themselves on the street, now becoming ever more rapidly
hidden by the dusk. Many people were passing, <i>habitués</i>
of the Quartier Latin; young men in uniform with girls
on their arms, skylarking, humming the chorus of “Madelon”;
old women making a last effort of the day to sell
bright-colored Rintintins and Ninettes fabricated out of
worsteds, those quaint little charms which were all the
rage in Paris, and which were supposed to make one safe
from Big Bertha and the bomb of the air raid. One
young girl passed clinging to the arm of a youth in a
broad hat, baggy corduroy trousers, paint-daubed coat,
and flowing tie—a figure who might have stepped out of
the pages of Henri Mürger. He seemed the very genius
of the Latin Quarter, a hungry <i>peintre</i> with canvas under
his arm, and his gay-hearted little mistress who cooked his
meals and shared his hunger and poverty brightly....
Kendall watched them go and envied them the thing that
was theirs. Now and then a gendarme, wearing his short
sword, passed stiffly.... It became darker and darker,
and the crowd in the café thinned itself away until nobody
remained but himself and Bert. Impatient waiters began
piling up chairs and moving tables against the wall.
Dim, hooded, blue street-lights glowed in the distance,
making the boulevard ghastly and somber.... The
darkness became impenetrable, but still Kendall lingered,
hoping, demanding that Andree’s dainty little figure
appear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No use, Ken,” Bert said. “She won’t come now, and
if she did you wouldn’t be able to see her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t go till I’m sure,” Ken answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s walk, then. More chance of seeing her out on
the sidewalk.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They arose and sauntered slowly toward the Panthéon,
crossing the very spot where Andree had given Kendall
that first kiss.... They retraced their steps. The
streets were now all but deserted; only here and there
was a hurrying figure, or upon some bench along the curb
a pair of lovers sitting close and whispering in each
other’s ears.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s eleven o’clock,” said Bert. “Come on home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said Ken. “It is too late now. She won’t
come to-night....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly the air was rent by the wail of the siren;
the avions were coming! One heard cries of anger or
fright, saw dark blots resolve into hurried action as
loiterers sought places of refuge.... A fire-engine swept
by with gnome-like black figures clinging to it, and that
voice like some horrid wail from the pit rising from it as
a fireman turned the handle of the siren.... It was a
voice that matched Kendall’s humor—a voice of despair,
a voice that made audible a thing which described to his
ear all that was evil and squalid and treacherous and
unforgivable that lurked in the black and stealthy warrens
of the world....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s get out of this,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall did not want to go, and the less so now that
there was danger.... Andree was in danger and, somehow,
he felt that his place, if it could not be with her,
was as near to her as he could station himself. He was
alarmed. People were killed in these air raids. There
were always casualties.... What if a bomb—what if
he should never be able to see Andree again to make
matters right with her? How if he should be prevented
from entreating her pardon for the ugly wrong he had
done her and for his brutality—he could recognize it as
brutality now.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet, mixed with all his self-accusation, his bitter heartache
and wretchedness, there ran a vein of relief—actual
relief, and of something like comfort. The pendulum of
his subconscious self was swaying downward, preparatory
to the upward sweep in the opposite direction.... The
world was good, there was good in the world. All was
not suspicion and sin; one might have faith in humanity....
The vestibule of the home church with its crowd
of bigots seemed cold and untrue now, though they had
appeared the one safe and living thing in the world so
short a time ago.... Andree was good. He had not been
mistaken in her; and if Andree was good, then other
things and people must be good likewise.... Even
Paris....</p>

<p class='c006'>They descended into the Metro whose underground
platforms were crowded with refuge-seekers of all classes
and ages, who clustered together and railed against the
<i>boche</i>. It was impossible to find a seat.... In half an
hour many were sitting on the concrete floor: mothers
with children sleeping in their laps; youths supporting
the heads of sweethearts on willing shoulders; sleepy
and frowsy old men and slatternly old women with hair
that hung gray and unpleasant before their eyes. A
gendarme prevented any from ascending the stairs to the
open air.</p>

<p class='c006'>It seemed hours, though it was only a trifle more than
an hour before the “all clear” was sounded. The mighty
clamor of the barrage and of falling bombs had penetrated
only as a dim rumble to that depth. There had been no
excitement, no exhilaration, only damp, cold discomfort.
The refugees made their way stiffly to the out-of-doors,
Kendall and Bert in their midst.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If I should never find her—” Ken said, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But if she should refuse to listen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Um.... I shouldn’t blame her. But you know her,
son, better than I. I saw her eyes to-night—and I
shouldn’t worry. They were the sort of eyes that forgive
much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said Kendall, slowly. “But she will remember.
She is that sort, too. She will never forget—and this
thing will always be there, never to be gotten rid of....
She will look at me, and I will see it in her eyes, that she
is wondering and that she is afraid—that I might do such
a thing again....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The trouble with you is too darn much imagination,”
Bert said, disgustedly. “Let’s get to bed. Work goes
on to-morrow, whatever happens.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Work would go on and life would go on; death would
continue to claim its own and births would replenish the
races of the earth; there would be sorrow and joy, sin
and repentance, squalor and luxury, in spite of anything
that happened to him.... Kendall seized upon this
thought. He was infinitely small, of less than negligible
importance in the world’s scheme.... Events would
transpire as usual, and the story of mankind would continue
adding to itself chapter by chapter. It was inevitable....
Just as it was inevitable that the <i>motif</i>
of the story should be love, and that so long as it should
continue to be love the good should predominate the evil,
and the ending, though it might threaten to be tragic,
must be happy for the majority. He saw, for the first
time, that a world in which love is the first essential cannot
be a lost world nor an unhappy world. He wondered if
love, in whatever form it showed itself, was not merely
the essence of <i>good</i> masquerading under another style.
In that case to love was to be virtuous.... He inclined
to believe it. The reflection made him easier of mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think I can sleep,” he said to Bert, and they turned
their faces homeward.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall Ware woke up to a world which was
not all straight lines and angles, which was not an
uncompromising and rule-of-thumb world as it had
seemed yesterday. To-day it was a world in which
curves and even curlicues were permissible. Yesterday
he was in sympathy with the Blue Laws and could have
understood a God who frowned if a man were to kiss his
wife of a Sabbath. To-day he could not comprehend the
attitude of yesterday, hardly remembered it, in fact.
He was young, and rapid changes of attitude were possible
to him as the heart was heavy or light, as events were kind
or harsh. It would not have been true to say that he
was light of heart this morning, but his heart was in a
condition to become light, needing only to find Andree
and to receive Andree’s forgiveness to make it so.</p>

<p class='c006'>As was characteristic, the pendulum of his convictions
had swung to the opposite and most remote point of its
arc; where yesterday any deviation from orthodox rule
and rigid form had been a sin, to-day he was inclined to
err on the side of liberality. It seemed, rather, as if
nothing could be wholly evil, and this simply because it
had been shown to him that Andree was not evil and that
his relations with her need not of necessity be degrading.
Yesterday he had been possessed by his inheritances from
his mother; to-day his father was in control. Just as the
one had been exaggerated, so now the other was in extreme....
And therefore he could conceive happiness
and stand upon the brink of happiness.... To be able
to perceive virtue is to be happy. It is a perception which
is its own reward....</p>

<p class='c006'>Last night he had been afraid he would never find
Andree; now he was certain she would be easy to find.
It was the matter of forgiveness that caused his uneasiness.
He had been brutal, harsh, presenting an unlovely spectacle.
It was such a spectacle of a man’s self as might
prove fatal to love, for who can love the unlovely? And
yet when he thought of Andree’s gentleness, her sweetness,
of all the many indications he had seen of a gracious
and tender character, he even dared to hope that he had
not offended past condoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>He arose impatiently, eager for the day to commence
so that it might end and enable him to take up his search.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert!” he called. “Up yet?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Getting up,” Bert answered, drowsily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is Arlette here yet?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Haven’t heard her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What in thunder’s getting into her! Doesn’t she know
a fellow’s got to have breakfast in the morning?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Huh—she isn’t due for quarter of an hour. What’s
the sudden rush?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before he was fully clothed Arlette rapped on his closed
door to demand his shoes, which he passed out to her,
together with his puttees, and walked into Bert’s room,
wearing bedroom slippers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some uniform,” said Bert, eying the spectacle. “Ought
to recommend it to the General Staff. Swagger, I call it.
Now if you only wore red socks.... H’m! How you
feeling this morning?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hungry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Surprising, seeing you didn’t eat anything all day
yesterday.” Bert studied his friend’s face covertly and
found reason for satisfaction. With more tact than his
character warranted one to expect, he let the subject
of yesterday rest there and did not again refer to it. He
finished shaving in his usual leisurely manner, put on his
blouse and belt, and was just in time to receive his shoes
and leggings from Arlette.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mind having dinner late to-night?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I hope Andree will be here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“H’m!... Want me to look up Madeleine?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rather you didn’t. We’ll—Well, you can see yourself
that we’ll have a lot of talking to do.... I’ve got to
square myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll clear out altogether and let you have the place
to yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No need. I might not—it’s possible I won’t find
her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert thought that was highly probable, but he did not
say so. “Just as you say,” he said. “What time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eight o’clock. If I’m not here by that time, go
ahead and eat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What about you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m going to camp in that café on the corner there
until I find her.” Ken’s jaws became prominent. “I’ll
stay there till I’m a permanent improvement.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette came in, casting apprehensive glances at
Kendall; she was unsmiling and had nothing to say
beyond the greetings of the morning. Ken realized that
he was in her disfavor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arlette,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>She paused in the door and, glancing up to his face
quickly, let her eyes shift to the carpet. “Yes, monsieur,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re angry with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non, monsieur.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes you are. You should be. I’ve been a fool.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked up again, this time scrutinizing his face
more carefully. “Monsieur did not conduct himself with
wisdom,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What should I have done, Arlette?” He was really
curious to know what she would answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is never wise to hurt where one is loved,” she said.
“Also one should be sure that no mistake is made—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But it was a mistake, Arlette.... If you loved as
you told me you did once, and the man you loved behaved
as I did, what would you do? Would you forgive
him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Me?” said Arlette. “Ah, who can say! It is many
years, and love is only a thing to remember sometimes....
But I, monsieur, was not as Mademoiselle Andree is.
Oh, no. There was weight to me, and a temper of the
highest. Oh yes, and I spoke many words with great
readiness. It is so.... What would you? Mademoiselle
Andree is not at any point the same. She is gentle and
sweet, monsieur, and it may be she is forgiving. As for me,
I think if any man had so behaved to me he would have
taken himself away with words in his ear that, I’ll warrant,
would have leaped through to his clumsy brain, <i>oui</i>, and
with other reminders that I was not to be dealt with after
such a manner.... But, as I have said, I was of a weight,
and my temper was high.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you would have forgiven?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette waggled her head and wiped her chin on the
back of her hand. “At least,” she said, “I should have
made him earn my forgiveness.... Oh, Monsieur Ken,
it was not well for you to treat her so; it was of a cruelty....
But I believe she will forgive; her eyes were of the
kind that forgive with too great readiness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She turned and was about to disappear when she leaned
far back to allow her face to present itself at a droll angle
in the doorway. “Jealousy,” she said, “is a disease that
makes heavy hearts. In very truth, I have seen it....
It is much better if one is not jealous. One cannot at the
same time be jealous and wise.... And always there
are regrets.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you have dinner at eight to-night? A nice dinner.
I hope to find Mademoiselle Andree and bring her home
again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Find her? But monsieur has but to go to her address.
She has not gone away?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know her address.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette sighed and waggled her head ponderously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then monsieur must apply to the police. All addresses
are known to the police.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I don’t know her name—only Andree.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Name of God!... Can such things be? Oh, these
Americans! Who has seen their like? Not know her
name, not know her address. It is of an impossibility!...
Does he speak truly, monsieur?” she demanded of
Bert, who nodded in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mon Dieu!... Mon Dieu!...</i>” she exclaimed, and
waddled off to the kitchen as if she dared no longer trust
her body in the presence of such a madman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There,” said Bert, “now you know what a respectable
body thinks of you. Apparently she thinks all Americans
are in the habit of cutting up such capers. Most likely
she believes addresses don’t count with us because we
live under trees like savages, and never go back to the
same tree twice....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anybody who doesn’t do things exactly as you yourself
do them is a savage. We think the French are
barbarians, the French think we are barbarians, and the
English consider both of us savages.... Come on, it’s
time we were starting.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When they reached the street Ken began to walk
swiftly, as if by hurrying now he could make the day pass
more quickly. At the office he plunged into his work,
taking only the briefest period for lunch. At five o’clock
he was on his way toward the Place St.-Michel to take
up his sentry-go there. Somehow he was confident he
would see Andree. What she did with her days he did
not know, but he imagined she went into the city. Certainly
she went somewhere, and to return she must
traverse the square from the Metro station over at the
left. He, therefore, took his station by the rim of the
fountain and watched each passer-by. It was tiresome
to watch and wait; the people did not interest him as they
had always interested him before. Quaint couples passed
unnoticed; children stopped to stare at him as he sat
on the flat rim of the basin; venders of Rintintin and
Ninette dangled their worsted dolls before him in vain.
Once or twice he thought he saw her coming, and stood
up eagerly, only to sink down again, disappointed....
And then he saw her coming; it was she unmistakably;
there was no mistaking that tam, that flimsy little dress,
that slender figure and her quaint, abstracted walk.</p>

<p class='c006'>Long before she saw him he was groping for words,
searching for the one thing to say, because he knew
that there must be some single thought that should be
put into words.... There must be some eloquent
sentence which would explain all, gain forgiveness for all.
But he could not find it. His French was gone; his
English would not take form.</p>

<p class='c006'>She crossed the square with little steps that seemed
almost stiff, her body very erect, as always, and her eyes
seeming to see nothing that went on about her. He
fancied a shade of sadness was added to the gravity of her
face.... She did not see him until he stood before her
and spoke, and it was no eloquent sentence that he
uttered, no wonderful thought that he put into words.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne!...</i>” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>She did not start, but merely stopped and raised her
eyes to his face slowly. There was no surprise, no emotion
of any sort to be seen, only that quaint gravity with
which he was so familiar. She stopped and waited, as she
always stopped and waited, ready, it seemed, to take her
cue from what was about to happen. She might never
have seen him before, but then, he thought, she always
met him so—as if she had never seen him before....
She did not speak; only waited.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was inarticulate, abashed, nonplussed. Suddenly
it seemed to him that there was nothing to say, nothing
that could be said. He had been guilty of conduct which
removed him forever from her life, which was unforgivable.
There was an impulse to turn and to hurry away from her,
but he repressed it.... He must do something, say
something.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m ashamed,” he said, clumsily. “I’ve been miserable....
I had to find you and tell you.... I—What
can I say? It was wicked—wicked....”</p>

<p class='c006'>He could go no farther, could only search her face with
his eyes for some reflection of her thoughts, for some
sign that he might hope for pardon. She did not
reply; there was no change in her expression, only
that unfathomable gravity and that air of suspended
judgment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Last night I tried to find you.... I sat and waited,
but you did not come. I couldn’t go to sleep until I
had begged you to forgive me.... I don’t deserve to
be forgiven. What I did—what I said, was unforgivable....
Oh, Andree!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a little pause, then she said, “You have been
sad?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I also,” she said, not reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—Never before have I known what it was to
suffer—and I have suffered. It was right that I should.
I deserved punishment.” Even here the Puritan in him
obtruded itself. “And you were so good, so sweet, so
wonderful.... I know all about it now—and I was
suspicious and brutal.... I was jealous, too. But I
didn’t know I was jealous.... When I thought you
were not good, it seemed to me that nothing in the world
could be good. Do you understand?... But there’s no
excuse for me. I should have known, and I should have
trusted you.... I didn’t even give you a chance to
explain....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, you speak ver’ fast. I cannot onderstan’ all....
But you have not been happy—no.... It is to
be seen.... At first I do not onderstan’, and I am ver’
sad and hurt—oh, ver’ sad. When I make to cross the
<i>pont</i> I look down at the water—yes.... And then I
say it is some mistake.... I say something have happen
I do not know of and it makes you to be not like Monsieur
Ken, but ver’ hurt and miserable and—how you say?—upset?
Yes. I say, also, that I love Monsieur Ken and
always that I am <i>fidèle</i>.... So what could it be?...
If, then, it is nothing, only some mistake, then I am
much sorry.... Not sorry for me, monsieur, who have
done no wrong, but for you, who are mos’ unhappy....
It is so. My heart it makes to weep for you because you
suffer....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Andree!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>She nodded her head gravely. “I do not onderstan’
<i>les Américains.... Non!... Non!</i> They are of a
difference. But I onderstan’ love which mus’ be the
same in America as in France, so I say Monsieur Ken
he is ver’ jealous and ver’ mistaken, and I mus’ be patient
and not sad more than is <i>nécessaire</i>.... So I wait till
thees mistake is not a mistake any more. And many
times I mus’ say to myself that you are jealous, and
therefore you love me. Because if there is not love, then
there is not to be jealous, <i>n’est-ce pas</i>? So I am almos’
happy, but not quite ... because you love me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you don’t hate me? You can forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, <i>mon bien cher ami</i>, there is nothing to forgive!
It is so.... It is only that I cried sometimes for you,
because you are mos’ miserable.... I say to theenk
how sad you are, and then I cry.... I would not have
you to be sad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It isn’t possible,” Ken said, more than half to himself.
“There’s nobody like this in the world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Possible?... <i>Pourquoi?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle Pourquoi—dear little Mademoiselle
Pourquoi!” he said, softly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are not angry with me any more—not jealous?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.... No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well.” She smiled for the first time and touched
his arm with her little hand. “Then I am joyous.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You ought to be joyous always.... You are wonderful.
When I think what you were giving up for me—and
that I could suspect you—I hate myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you are not sad now? There is not any mistake
any more, and we are together. You are not sad?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sad, <i>mignonne</i>!... Only when I think of what I said
to you—things you can never forget—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never forget?” She laughed a little. “Behol’,
already I have forgotten. It is as if nothing ever happen’.
I do not remember. Now”—she made that old
familiar gesture of pointing repeatedly to the sidewalk
with her finger to indicate the identical present second—“now
I remember nothing. I do not know what you
talk about.... You are ver’ droll, Monsieur Ken, to be
speak so much about something I do not know ... about
a something that have never happen’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall felt something that was almost reverence for
her; it was more than wonder and little less than awe.
Never until that moment had he conceived of the possibility
that such greatness of heart, such forgetfulness of
self, such <i>rightness</i> could exist in the world.... He felt
himself incapable of appreciating, of appraising the gold
of her heart. It was very sweet, very radiant, that
moment. There must be a goodness in the world more
marvelous, purer, worthier than he had been able to
imagine, and Andree possessed it.... And, possessing
that goodness, she could not in any particular be evil.
She would see rightly, and evil that was truly evil would
be abhorrent in her eyes. His last doubt, his last fear,
his last self-accusation departed from him; in his elation
he was unable to perceive that a thing virtuous in Andree
and for Andree might be quite other for himself....</p>

<p class='c006'>“You gave up everything for me—your chance to enter
the <i>Académie</i>, to go on the stage ... to be famous,
perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, that!...” She smiled up at him. “Nothing
in the worl’ is so good to have as love. It is so. It is a
ver’ great theeng. One leetle hour, one day of love—that
is more great and more necessary to have than the
mos’ fame that can be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do love me, Andree? Say it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I love you,” she said, gently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can never let you out of my sight again. You must
be with me always—where I can see you and touch you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She smiled up at him, but there was a shade of sadness,
perhaps of apprehension, in her deep-shadowed black
eyes. “It is not possible,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arlette has dinner waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To-night? Now.... Oh, it is not possible....”
She made a pretty gesture of dismay.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is necessary. To prove that you have forgiven me.
I couldn’t let you go now ... now that I’ve found you
again. Come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked down at the walk a moment with detached
gravity, then put her fingers on his arm. “Ver’ well,”
she said. “You mus’ take me off like <i>prisonnier de guerre,
n’est-ce pas</i>?... You have capture me, so what am I
to do? I am ver’ helpless.... You mus’ say many
sweet theengs to me so that I am not sad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They crossed the street to the Metro station and
descended to the crowded train in which they were compelled
to stand until they reached the Châtelet station,
where they changed to the line that runs under the
rue de Rivoli and the Champs Élysées. It was impossible
to talk except in occasional monosyllables, but every
now and then Kendall would look down into Andree’s
face, always to find her looking up at him gravely, but
happily. Then he would press her arm gently, and she
would respond by nestling his fingers between her arm
and her body. He was happy, boyishly happy. It was a
new sort of happiness for him—a great, surging happiness
which made the world lovely, which made even standing
in a swaying subway car, jostled and elbowed by a tired
crowd, a delectable thing.</p>

<p class='c006'>He yearned toward Andree as he had never yearned
toward her before. He wanted to hold her in his arms,
not passionately, but gently. He was filled with a
desire to show a great gentleness and consideration for
her, to prove to her that he was kind. He wanted to protect
her, to shield her, to deal with her as he would have
dealt with a tired, trusting child, for she seemed very
childlike to him, with all the purity and heart honesty
of a child.... He magnified the thing she had done,
and the beauty of her forgiveness, repeating over and
over in his thoughts that she was good, wonderfully,
miraculously good.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne!...</i>” he whispered in her ear, and she
smiled up at him and pressed his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last they alighted and mounted to the street, and
there he attempted to keep step with her tiny, severe
strides until both of them laughed gaily at his efforts.
She was all child now, laughing, roguish, teasing. She
rattled French at him, well knowing he could not understand,
and laughed at him for not understanding, and he
pretended to believe she was telling him that he was
ugly and cross-eyed and that she was ashamed to walk
with him. Then they were at the apartment, and Ken
greeted the <i>concierge</i> with a cordiality that left the old
lady a little amazed and wondering if her American officer
had not been dealing too liberally with the wines of the
country.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I shall not walk up these so many stairs,” Andree
said, with her pretty mock despair. “It is not possible.
You have not made an <i>ascenseur</i>. It was a promise....
Oui. And until you fetch one I shall remain here, on this
spot.” She indicated the spot severely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll be the <i>ascenseur</i>,” he volunteered, and made as if
to lift her in his arms, but she slipped away and danced
up the stairs before him, making believe, as she approached
each floor, to be on the point of dropping from exhaustion,
and counting each floor with dismay.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So much have we climb’ and it only is the <i>premier
étage.... Oo là là....</i> For hours we mount, and
arrive but at the secon’—what do you say?—secon’
floor. It is ver’ fonny. Secon’ floor. <i>Mais, mon bien
cher ami</i>, it sound’ like nothing at all, on’y jus’ sound....
Secon’ floor!... Such a language is thees Engleesh!”</p>

<p class='c006'>They arrived at the fourth floor honestly panting, and
she sank into a chair while Kendall searched under the
mat for the key.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will go no more,” she said, firmly. “I am <i>blessée</i>.
I am one <i>poilu</i> with the bad wound. It is not possible to
proceed. Behol’, I am one <i>poilu</i>.” She puffed out her
cheeks and frowned. “<i>Sacré nom d’une pipe!...</i> It is
so the <i>poilu</i> swears....”</p>

<p class='c006'>He thrust open the door and, picking her slight form up
as he might have lifted little Arlette, he carried her inside
and set her down before the hall tree.... His hands
rested on her shoulders and they both became grave,
looking into each other’s eyes.... And then he drew
her close to him and pressed his lips to hers....</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette padded into the hall, attracted by the sound,
observed what she observed, folded her pudgy hands on
her stomach, and stared with amazement. “<i>Mon Dieu!...
Mon Dieu!...</i>” she exclaimed, and padded away
again in confusion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then they went into the <i>salon</i>, where Bert was reading
the paper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve found her,” Ken said, gaily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So I observe.” Bert’s voice was dry.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your voice must not be so w’en you speak to Monsieur
Ken,” Andree said, severely. “<i>Non....</i> I will not
have it so. Bicause he is ver’ good, and nobody mus’ be—w’at
you say?—cross with him—so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” Bert said, “I’ll be gentle with the child,
mademoiselle, though it’s contrary to my duty.” He
turned to Ken. “You seem to have put it over,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert, she’s wonderful—she’s—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve heard just two hundred and seven men say that
at one time and another. Seems to be a stock phrase in
the language of young gentlemen in your state of mind....
Anyhow, I’m glad the rumpus is settled. I can
get some sleep now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Does he scold you?” Andree asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It doesn’t matter what he does,” Ken said, laughingly.
“Nothing matters.... There’s Arlette’s head through
the door. Let’s eat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette served silently, but as she moved about the
table she kept her eyes furtively upon Andree, and her
lips moved constantly without uttering a sound. This
continued until it was time to remove the meat, and then
Arlette could contain herself no longer. She reached the
door on her way to the kitchen with the platter, when,
with startling suddenness, she turned, replaced the platter
on the edge of the table, folded her hands across her stomach,
rolled her eyes to heaven, and launched upon a
harangue in such rapid French that it seemed one continuous
word of mingled syllables.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree listened gravely, nodding her head the merest
trifle every moment or so. Then Arlette paused expectantly
and Andree replied with all the gravity of a
Cabinet Minister facing a crisis. At the end of a sentence
she got out of her chair and walked to Ken and put her
arm about his neck and her cheek to his, continuing
the reply thence. Arlette rolled her eyes and waggled
her head and heaved great sighs.... Presently her set
face relaxed and she smiled and wiped her chin on the
back of her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mon Dieu!...</i>” she said. “<i>Mon Dieu!...</i>” and
with a tremulous smile which, somehow, was not at all
absurd on her heavy face—was almost tender—she retreated
with suddenness to her kitchen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” said Ken, “what now, <i>mignonne</i>? What’s it all
about?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree shook her head gaily. “No!... No!...
It is not for you. I shall not speak it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was it so terrible as that?... I’m afraid I have
made an enemy of Arlette.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But no. Well, dear friend, it is that she have much
worry for you. Yes. She have much worry. She theenk
you—oh, it is ver’ fonny!—she theenk you are leetle child
that is lost and also is mad! She theenk something
happen to you if you have no one to take care of you.
She tell me I mus’ not be angry with you, but ver’ nice
and kind always, bicause it is not your fault you are
a baby and mad.... Oh yes. She say she love you
like she is your <i>marraine</i>, but she is powerless to make
you to be protected.... And she theenk I mus’ take
you by the hand same theeng as you are blind.... So
I have promise’, and now she will not worry, but gives
you to me to care for. She have been mos’ unhappy.
She say that only God can onderstan’ a mad American
who is in love!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arlette,” said Bert, “is a woman of sound judgment.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where is Mademoiselle Madeleine?” Andree asked,
with one of those sudden changes of subject which were
characteristic of her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I haven’t the least idea.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why is she not here? I want her to be here. I
would speak of many things to her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Blame Ken there. I suggested having Madeleine,
but he said he wanted you all by yourself with nobody
else around.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She turned to look at Ken as if to satisfy herself if this
were truth or jesting, and then she smiled the merest
trifle. “It is well,” she said, softly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m on my way,” said Bert, arising. “Got a bridge
game on at the Union.... <i>Bon soir, mademoiselle....</i>
And you, Ken, keep your feet on the ground.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Keep your feet on the groun’,’” repeated Andree,
when Bert was gone. “Oh, it mean nothing whatever.
Thees English language, it is <i>très-drôle</i>. What is thees keep
your feet on the groun’?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It means that Bert agrees with Arlette that I need
somebody to look after me,” he said, a bit ruefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well. Here am I—here—here.” She laughed
that fairy laugh, and poked her finger toward the floor
many times. “I am here, so he mus’ not be afraid. I
shall look after you. Oh yes, I shall be mos’ firm and
ver’ stern. You shall see.” And she made a tremendous
face to show him what severity she was capable of.</p>

<p class='c006'>They went into the <i>salon</i>, with its absurd bronze statues,
its tasteless gilt furniture, and its absurd little throne
between the windows. Andree must observe herself closely
before the huge glass above the fireplace and do little
unnecessary things to her hair and touch her nose with a
powder-puff. Ken watched her delightedly, and then carried
her to her throne, where she sat dangling her tiny
feet while he closed the heavy iron shutters to make it
lawful for him to turn on the lights.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree moved over to the sofa, looking up at him with
that gravely curious expression which he saw so often
on her face; she seemed to be wondering, always wondering,
about something. Was it possible he was as strange,
as unusual, as interesting to her as she was to him? He
would have given much to know just what she was thinking,
but, somehow, even then it was borne in upon him
that he should never know—that she would always remain
a sweet, bewildering, exotic mystery to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sit by me—ver’ close,” she said; and he sat by her
and took her in his arms, while she snuggled against him
with the contented sigh of a child.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you love me?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c006'>She nodded emphatically, and then with an upward
glance said, as she always said, “And you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“More than I can say.... <i>Toujours</i>—always. I
shall always love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well.... We shall make the pretense it is so—that
you love me always. But the little moments, they
are so sweet—well, dear friend, that they could not be
always. Is it not so? If it could be always then I
theenk God He would be jealous.... No.... But
we mus’ pretend. We mus’ pretend there is no war, and
that you shall never go to <i>Amérique</i> again ... and leave
me <i>solitaire</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was silent. This was a thought that had been
growing in his mind from day to day, a thought he had
refused to face or to consider. What was to be the end
of it all? Suppose he should be ordered home in a week
or a month. What then?... He did not know, and he
was unwilling to ask himself. Rather he would be contented
with the little minutes and let each day care for
each day’s problems. When the day of his return arrived,
then the thing must be faced and the question
answered.... But to-night he loved her; wanted to
think of nothing but love and the happiness that such a
sweetheart could bestow.... She seemed to wait for
some answer, for some assurance, but he had none to
make, and presently she said, but not with the same
happy note in her voice:</p>

<p class='c006'>“It may be that love is so great a thing that it cannot
live forever—as it is for us. Behol’—one has a mos’
beautiful jewel, and it is ver’ nice and there is much joy
to have it. But consider—if everything one had is jewels,
jewels, jewels, then the firs’ jewel it is not so nice, so
wonderful. <i>N’est-ce pas?</i> It may be it is the same theeng
with love. Do you onderstan’? It is great and ver’
beautiful bicause it is only for the leetle moments w’en
one is yo’ng—and w’en the heart it is ready for love.... I
theenk this is so. Then, what can matter, <i>bien cher ami</i>?
Thees love of now is the mos’ bes’ theeng of all life ... bicause,
maybe, it cannot live much long.... Yes, yes,
I have seen many ol’ man and ol’ woman who say they
remember thees love—but not one who say he has thees
love still. You see I theenk of it much....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, honey.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And so I have not fear that you go.... I have only
fear that something happen bifore our little moment of
happiness is done—never to come back again. Do you
onderstan’? One day, for all, thees love it begins to
fade and be less lovely. It becomes less strong and not
weeth such wonderfulness.... I have seen. At las’ it
is but a friendship and a memory. But it is a great and
a fine friendship bicause of the memory. Is it not so?...
And that is marriage, my friend ... that friendship.
It is but a good regard of each for the other which comes
like the bread after the beautiful growing wheat....
Am I ver’ foolish?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.... No....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bicause of thees that I believe, then I am not sad,
but ver’ happy, and I do not fear. I have what is worth
all other theengs—thees leetle moment of happiness which
is love.... I would pay for it weeth ever’thing. It is
worth to pay for weeth much sorrow and weeth much
loneliness.... If you mus’ go—well, dear friend, let it
be bifore thees leetle moment fades.... But we mus’
pretend it shall never fade and that we are together
always as thees.... It is more better so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She drew his lips down to hers, and he knew that blind,
throbbing, winged happiness which has no language, no
symbols, no words of description, which can never be
remembered except as a mysterious, haunting ecstasy
which once was living and real, which leaves behind but
the dim outline of its spirit and an elusive something as
of a sweet scent that once tingled the nostrils for an
instant, to be wafted away forever....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Now commenced a brief period which was, perhaps,
to be the happiest of Kendall Ware’s whole life.
It was happy because it was free from doubts and questionings.
From the depths he had mounted to the
heights from which he looked upon a world bathed in
sunshine, rich in harvest, beautiful as a world could be
beautiful only when it was freed from all evil. He saw
everything as good, and it contented him. He ate of
the lotus of inexperienced youth, flavored with the pungent
spice of sophistry, and the taste of it was sweet in his
mouth. Plymouth Rock had sunk beneath its sands, the
vestibule of the Presbyterian church had vanished behind
the mists of an intervening ocean. He did not think;
he only felt and acted—and was happy.</p>

<p class='c006'>His work was interesting, and he could recognize its
value, so he became less dissatisfied with the necessity
that held him far behind the battle-line. Not that he was
content, rather that he was resigned.... And at the
end of the day there was Andree....</p>

<p class='c006'>There were few evenings which they did not spend together,
either by themselves or with Bert and Madeleine,
dining at home, at Poccardi’s, at Marty’s, or in interesting,
homelike little cafés across the river where excellent
food could be had very cheaply. Sometimes they went
to the theater or to the music-halls. Sometimes they
strolled up and down the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne
until they were tired and then sat and talked contentedly
on springy iron chairs along the promenade. Once they
walked out that street, so crowded of evenings—that
street of the ever-changing names—Montmartre, Poissonnière,
Nouvelle, St.-Denis, St.-Martin—as far as the
Place de la République. It was interesting, if tiresome.
More than once Kendall was impressed with the fact that
Parisians of a certain class take their pleasures simply
and childishly. More than one glaring palace, open at the
front, showed rows upon rows of those devices, long extinct
in America, before which one could sit or stand with
the ends of a rubber tube in one’s ears and listen to such
tunes as found favor with him played by phonograph.
The popularity of these places surprised him. They were
always crowded.... It seemed to him that this was the
most crowded thoroughfare in Paris, as well as one of the
most questionable. The crowds impressed him as being
questionable and bent on questionable errands.... And
yet he did not know; he only guessed. So far as his
knowledge went, these folk might be the most respectable
in all France—all save the numerous soft-voice girls who
threaded their way in and out.... And for a mere
child, a girl who seemed hardly in her teens, who bit and
struggled in the hands of two gendarmes, shrieking in a
voice that remained long in Kendall’s ears, “I have the
age!... I have the age!... I have the age!...” over
and over again....</p>

<p class='c006'>Madeleine had laughed and shrugged her shoulders with
some flippant word of comment, but Kendall looked down
at Andree to see her eyes moist and big with pity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pauvre p’tite!... Pauvre p’tite!...</i> It is not she
who should be punish’. She have made no wrong.... I
theenk it is the crime of poverty. <i>N’est-ce pas?</i> Oh, to be
<i>pauvre</i>—it is not well....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yet <i>le bon Dieu</i> permits it,” said Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non!... Non!...</i> It is not of God, ma’m’selle; it
is of man—thees poverty and thees awful theengs....
It mus’ be that tears come often to the eyes of the good
God....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was affected deeply. She spoke of the good
God with such simplicity, with the sort of intimacy which
children use. He felt almost a reverence for her....
There was a <i>rightness</i> about her, a simple, unaffected,
unconscious <i>goodness</i>, that set her apart and made her
different, to him, from all mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne!</i>” he whispered, and pressed her arm, and
she, looking up shyly into his face, gave answering pressure,
and, perhaps, wondered a little.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was always so, never changing, yet always possessed
of that infinite variety of which Shakespeare speaks. But
it was a variety which was always Andree. In no mood,
in no manifestation, could she be anything but Andree.
If she were sad, it was with a sadness peculiar to her, and
very lovable; if she were gay, it was with her own gaiety;
if she were mischievous, it was with a charming impishness
which no other being could have managed. And always
she was natural—as natural as the rain that falls or the
sun that shines or the breezes that blow.... She was
Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To-morrow is the great fête,” said Andree. “There
will be much to see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I can’t show it to you. I must work in the morning,
and in the afternoon I am ordered to go to the front.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How long?” she said, quickly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But one day. I shall be here again Sunday—and we
shall play, eh? We shall have <i>déjeuner</i> together and do
something in the afternoon, and find a place to dine....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well—but you mus’ be ver’ careful. You mus’
not let the <i>boche</i> keel you.... Oh, I should be sad, sad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Already Paris was dressing for the American fête-day,
the Fourth of July, which, by methods of law, had been
made her own national holiday this year. Everywhere
were American flags. There was no house in Paris too
poor to show some small copy of the Stars and Stripes,
for just now Paris was mad about America and Americans ... as
it had had its day of madness over the Belgians
and then the English. Paris is given to such enthusiasms,
and at the moment there were men in the service of the
great god Propaganda who labored to bring it about that
this latest passion should not die and become sudden
ashes as the others had done, but rather to persuade it
to subside slowly, unnoticeably, leaving a pleasant memory
behind....</p>

<p class='c006'>“The <i>boches</i> will pull something off to-morrow,” said
Bert. “You see. They’ll do something to bust up the
celebration.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This was the opinion of the Paris streets—that the Hun
would, by some ingenious and disagreeable means, make
the fête memorable in the history of the city.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Maybe it’s just as well I’m going away,” laughed
Ken. “So you, Ma’m’selle Pourquoi—you look out for
yourself. Don’t you let anything hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Me—<i>pouf</i>!... It could not be. While there is
you nothing can happen to me—nothing. I am ver’
safe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They tried in vain to persuade a <i>voiture</i> or a taxicab to
take them home, but, with that perversity which belongs
to the Paris cabby alone, none of them would go. One
reason or another was given—the horse was tired, the
gasolene supply was depleted, it was the wrong quarter of
the city. A large volume, serious or comic, might be
written on the habits and moods of these public conveyances
of the most charming city in the world. Paris
would not be the same without them. While they are
one of the irritations, none the less they are of the quaint
and pleasant memories of the city, and Kendall could
often see himself, as he sat at some future day, retailing
to audiences of less traveled Americans than he his
adventures with the war-time taxi.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally they were obliged to descend to the Metro,
which carried them to the Place de l’Opéra, to change
there for the short ride to the Palais Royal, where another
change was necessary to carry them to the Étoile. It
was late and they were tired.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, we have make the <i>beaucoup travail</i>—the so great
labor thees day,” said Andree, shaking her head. “I have
the <i>fatigue</i>.... But it is well to be weary. Are you
weary, Monsieur Ken?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am happy,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.... Yes.... That is bes’ of all—to be happy.
Tell me, when you have gone to the front—will you
theenk of me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In the morning, at noon, in the afternoon—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, oh!... It is not possible. But sometimes.
Once, twice? For I shall be theenking of you always.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you love me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she nodded emphatically, and then—he would
have missed it had she omitted it—“and you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“More than anybody in the world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“More than thees yo’ng American girl?... I have
seen her thees day. She is in Paris. Do you know?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must be mistaken, <i>mignonne</i>. Miss Knox is out
at the front.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is so.... It is so. I have seen her—thees day.
Oh, do you theenk I do not know her? I am ver’ <i>jalouse</i>—mos’
<i>jalouse</i>. She come for take you away from me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t you let her do it,” said Ken happily. “Don’t
you dare let her do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know,” she said, becoming suddenly grave.
“You are American—she is American.... Some day...”
Then she laughed gaily, impishly. “<i>Mais</i> these American
girl, they do not know how to dress. Oh, it is terrible!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mustn’t judge all American women by these
uniforms you see in France,” said Bert. “Just now it is
the style in America for women to get into something
they think are uniforms. I wonder who designed these
Y. M. C. A. uniforms, anyhow?... But really, Mademoiselle
Andree, our women do know how to dress.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have never seen,” she said, stubbornly. “Also they
do not always wear uniforms, but always they wear their
feet. Their feet they cannot take off. <i>Mais non.</i> It
is too bad. If only they could leave at home their feet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall suspected that American women were suffering
for the sins of Maude Knox, so he did not rush to their
defense. He did not want to think about Maude Knox
to-night—he wanted to think of no woman but Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Méchante!</i>” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is so—what I say,” she said, severely. “I do not
like American women.... I do not like thees girl. She
ees ver’ wicked, for she wish to steal you from me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The street was very dark. Kendall made youth’s
answer to youth’s jealousy. He lifted her slight form in
his arms and kissed her until she returned his kisses.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There,” he said, “you are punished.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It ees ver’ nice to be wicked,” she said. “Thees
punishment is ver’ well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude Knox was banished. They two found themselves
the sole inhabitants of a brightly glowing world....</p>

<p class='c006'>Next morning Kendall made his way through early
assembling crowds to his office, where he was much occupied
until noon, making preparations for his trip to the
front. Then he was driven through the holiday-making
streets crowded with a populace in holiday humor to the
<i>barrière</i>, and thence into the country. On every building
waved an American flag, in every buttonhole was a tiny
American flag, and the appearance of an American
military automobile was the signal for applause and lifting
of hats. Small boys shouted as small boys of all countries
shout; friendly old gentlemen waved their canes; young
women smiled broadly or demurely, invitingly or shyly.
Kendall felt as if he were enjoying some sort of a triumph,
as if this celebration were for him. The frankness and
open-heartedness and courtesy of it were delightful.</p>

<p class='c006'>They drove rapidly through little villages, between
rolling fields cultivated as only the French agriculturist
seems to be able to cultivate. The villages, too, were in
gala dress and the people in holiday attire. In one place
a brief stop was made. Immediately the car was surrounded
by children who shouted eagerly for “penny,”
for “gu-um,” for “cigarette.” So it was all over France.
Let but an American soldier appear and the children of
the neighborhood formed a group about him demanding
tribute.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon the civil inhabitants disappeared. Whole villages
were occupied by billeted troops, <i>poilus</i> and colonials,
black-skinned men wearing red fezzes and speaking
strange tongues who gave to the picture an exotic tint.
The countryside swarmed with soldiers <i>en repos</i>, a zone
miles deep crowded with the guardians of Paris and of the
Channel ports.... Now came forests in whose depths
could be caught fleeting glimpses of huge ammunition-dumps,
skilfully camouflaged, then a wonderful woods,
clean as the floor of a kitchen, a forest of magnificent
trees, but as well kept as a Michigan peach-orchard....
Dusk descended, then darkness. The car seemed to be
running into a black curtain upon a thread of white
cloud. Kendall could not see the length of his nose to one
side or the other, but ahead could be discerned that pale
cloud avenue, a sort of milky way that disappeared itself
into blackness a hundred feet away. He was now upon
one of those roads of white chalk, deep with dust which
arose in clouds and nestled in the hair and eyebrows and
penetrated the very pores of the skin, giving to men the
singular appearance of having been carved out of bronze.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently the horizon glowed for an instant, as with
heat lightning, and glowed again and again. There was
a mutter and a grumble ahead which was the distant
voice of the guns.... Something burst into flower in
the sky far ahead, a vivid rose-blossom, then another and
another. It was shrapnel, either our own demanding toll
of a prowling German aeroplane or the enemy searching
the air for an Allied machine.... The heat lightning
became continuous, the roar of the guns a rumble without
break, almost a single, sustained note.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken was riding in the depths of a sea of blackness.
To right and left the eyes encountered an <i>impasse</i>; ahead
was only that dim milky way of road and those upsurging
lights as the guns answered one another across
the desert of No Man’s Land. The car was traveling at
breakneck speed. Suddenly came a tremendous snap
almost in Ken’s ears, a snap as of a mountain being
cracked in twain by giant hands. There was a blinding
flash across the road ahead and the air was usurped by
the scream of a departing shell. A battery by the roadside
had taken up its work of the night. Kendall was in
the midst of it now. Guns on both sides cracked and
roared; projectiles screamed over his head, and now and
then would come that easily distinguishable sound, the
bursting of a German shell....</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently the road sank below the level of the fields.
The car was running between irregular rows of barely
discernible lights which appeared to issue from the
ground—as indeed they did—glowing from the dugouts
of French artillerymen who had burrowed into the banks
at the side of the road. The moon began to climb so that
objects became dimly visible. The scene was like that of
some village of prehistoric cave-dwellers, save for those
breaks in the line of dugouts, cunningly covered with
nets of camouflage, under which lurked the cannon,
muzzles directed toward the foe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now they stopped in a battered, deserted village which
was headquarters of our Twenty-eighth Infantry, a component
of that First Division made up of our old regulars—a
body of troops whose name will be famous as long as
the history of America shall endure. And there, in an
enormous dugout entered through a narrow tunnel some
fifty feet in length, Ken found shelter for the night. He
traversed the tunnel, descended steps carved out of the
stone to a level twenty feet below, and found himself
in a warren. Here, notwithstanding the hour of the
night, were bustle and activity. Here were offices where
sounded the click of typewriters and the staccato of the
telephone; here were passages, bedrooms, a dining-room—a
veritable maze hewn out of the chalk formation.
It was as if Ali Baba’s forty thieves had turned systematic
and were carrying on their trade according to modern
business methods. Yet men worked here as casually
and nonchalantly, accustomed by long habit, as they
would have worked in their New York offices....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall was provided with a cot, and, despite the
sounds that penetrated here, the sounds of the Fourth
of July celebration of the First Division, he slept....</p>

<p class='c006'>Early in the morning he awoke, then, after some hours
spent with the regimental intelligence officer, he walked
abroad to see this historic countryside. Far off to the
left the glasses showed him that spot which had been
Montdidier; almost straight ahead was the grisly, silent
crumble known now to the world by the name of Cantigny.</p>

<p class='c006'>The day was beautiful. It seemed strange, unnatural
that the country should be so beautiful as well. Even
the gun-pits among which Kendall quickly found himself
did not detract from the beauty, for they were almost
invisible even at a distance of a few yards, only appearing
as low mounds, scarcely differing in color from the surrounding
fields. Yet the guns were there under their
tents of chicken-wire covered with stained burlap and
grasses. Everywhere he looked were these mounds which
during the night that had just passed had been uncovered
to the sky while shells filled with deadly gas had screamed
through intervening miles of air to fall with deadly effect
in the German lines.... It had been mustard gas, six
thousand rounds of it, he had been told. He was also
told it was the first time American gunners had been supplied
with that devilishness of war—to celebrate the
Fourth.... Now the gun-pits were neat as a New
England parlor, guns were brightly polished. Nothing
seemed to have happened there.</p>

<p class='c006'>He stood above and looked down the slope of the valley,
a valley of golden fields, a valley which was a miracle
of color. Never had Kendall seen such color, acres
upon acres of it, nor such a profusion of flowers. Gold
and red and white and blue ... and <i>peace</i>! That valley
had been spread there for some painter—not for a battle-field.
It impressed the inherited mysticism in him—he
saw a symbolism in it all. The fields blazed with gorgeous
tints; rectangles acres in extent were red with poppies,
not with a sprinkling of poppies here and there, but as
with a snowfall of vivid red. Segregated in an adjoining
field were cornflowers, a carpet of blue; and then another
field glaring white with some flower that Kendall did not
know.... Other fields there were in which the three
flowers mingled. The panorama spoke of peace and beauty....
It was as if the war irritated God until He spread
this, His own camouflage of peace, to hide the horrors
from His down-gazing eyes.... Or perhaps, as of olden
times He had set His rainbow in the sky as a promise to
the sons of Noah, so now He planted this living rainbow
in the fields as a new and more wonderful promise to all
the sons of men ... a promise that His purposes should
nevermore demand another war to devastate the earth....</p>

<p class='c006'>Before him, knee-deep in poppies, moved half a dozen
figures in khaki.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The boys are gathering flowers for the funeral,” he
was told.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The funeral?...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of the men killed last night....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently, his business completed, he was driving toward
Paris, reached Paris in the darkness with a feeling of
home-coming and pleasure.... But he was thoughtful,
troubled. His sternly believing mother was awake in him,
asserting that he had seen with his own eyes a movement
of the finger of God—that he had read a sign from Omnipotence.
It weighed him down, filled him not with
joyous faith, but with Calvinistic gloom to have this
assurance that God was actually taking an active interest
in His world.... The weight of the knowledge of the
existence of a Deity was upon him as it had been upon
his stern forebears—the knowledge of the existence of a
Deity, stern, forbidding, cruel in his revenges and implacable
in his demands ... not of such a God as
Andree knew—whose eyes might be wet with tears caused
by the sufferings of His puppets to whom He had vouchsaved
the dubious boon of freedom of action....</p>

<p class='c006'>He awoke in the morning as one awakes from an impressive
dream, with a feeling of heaviness upon him, a
consciousness of his personal existence that made him
dull company at breakfast. This humor did not pass
away, it was rather laid aside for further reference and
obscured by the events and anticipations of the day.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good trip?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fine! Saw a lot.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wish I could get a crack at it sometime. I haven’t
heard a gun go off yet—except in an air raid.... Was
anything stirring up there?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken described his experiences of the day and night,
and, strangely, from a different viewpoint than that from
which he had beheld them. Yesterday the thing had been
subjective, symbolical; to-day it was objective. He described
the war he had seen as a tourist might describe
some interesting scene in a foreign country—and he rather
wondered at himself that he could think of it in that
manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When do you meet Andree?” Bert asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eleven o’clock—at the Place de la Concorde. You
and Madeleine are coming along?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sure! We’ll pick you up there at eleven.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anything happen here yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a thing. The <i>boches</i> disappointed everybody. I
went to one of those dinners the crowd at the Union
are always piloting a fellow to—this Society of French
Homes, or whatever they call it.... Four of us dined
with a Madame Lefebvre.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Interesting. Played bridge with three French people,
a deputy and two women. None of them spoke a word
of English, but we made out pretty well. I won thirty
francs.... They were rather upper crust in this town,
I guess. Fine house and that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must go to one of those some day,” said Ken, reflectively.
“I’ve wondered if we were really seeing Paris—the
way the French live.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not if that dinner last night was a sample. I had to
lug out all my manners. And the women—they sort of
made me feel uncomfortable. Dignified, you know, but
very friendly. It was all the family. Old grandmother
and her sons and daughters and a few grandchildren.
Patriarchal affair.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I want to see that sort of thing. People have told me
that French family life is beautiful.... One wouldn’t
think it to judge from what we’ve seen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know about the beautiful,” said Bert, and
Ken registered a thought that Bert would not be likely
to notice domestic beauties, “but there was something
fine about it. I liked it.... That old grandmother was
bully. They were all so doggone respectful.... And
there was a young lieutenant, a grandson—had his face
shot away. Nothing left but his mouth and one eye.
Wore a big triangular patch over his face. He must have
been quite a fellow, though. Had the Croix de Guerre
and the Legion of Honor and the Médaille Militaire.
Just been married, too—to a mighty nice little girl—one
of these home bodies, looked as though. And, by
Jove! she acted like she was a heap in love with him.
It sort of got me—especially when everybody in the room
took the opportunity at some time during the evening to
tell me that she never met him until after he was mutilated....
I don’t believe that sort of girl would pick
up with a fellow, somehow. And I know mighty well
her mother and grandmother never would have. I guess
there are all kinds of French people, just the same as
there are Americans....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course,” said Ken, out of his abysmal ignorance.
Then, defensively, “Maybe these aristocrats are different
from the girls we know, but, I don’t care how they
live or how straitlaced they are, they’re no better than
Andree.... Andree’s <i>good</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sure,” said Bert, “and you’re dotty.... Meet you
at eleven.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken wrote a few letters home, one to his mother in
which he went rather to descriptions and very little to
personal matters. He spoke little of France and the
French, but rather made it appear that he was living in
a Paris inhabited exclusively by American soldiers who
were all so busy with the war that they had no time to
do anything else but work and sleep. He did mention
seeing Notre Dame ... which was a church, and of undoubted
historic interest. It was a very circumspect
letter, and not at all confidential.... But it is an undoubted
fact that mothers and fathers have to earn by
their conduct toward their children those confidences
which they seem to fancy are theirs by right. Ken could
have told his father anything—everything. But his
mother—somehow it was difficult for him to compel
himself to make the most trivial disclosure to her. Her
attitude toward him and toward the world had created
that difficulty. The young are naturally confidential....</p>

<p class='c006'>Then he went to meet Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the delights of Ken’s acquaintance with Andree
was that each meeting with her seemed a fresh adventure;
there was a sameness about these meetings. Andree
always appeared just so, and conducted herself just so.
He could foretell with exactitude what her every movement
and gesture and word would be when she did
appear. But somehow, probably unconsciously, she was
able to impart to every rendezvous a freshness, an
air of mystery, something elusive and elfin that made
them, no matter how often repeated, always alluring,
exciting, delightful. Her sudden appearances out of a
life of which he knew nothing and her disappearances
back into that life lifted this affair above the level of
all other affairs, imparting to it something of the occult,
giving play to the imagination.... Ken cherished this
illusion and, therefore, though often tempted, he asked
no questions. Even now he did not know her name—only
Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently she appeared, just as he knew she would
appear, walking very erect, with little steps that seemed
almost stiff, her eyes cast downward or staring straight
before her and seeming to see nothing whatever. He
knew that she would approach within reach of his hand
before she gave sign of recognition, and then she would
regard him with grave query as if to ascertain if it were
really he, and if, as she feared, she was not welcome.
And then she would smile timidly, without taking her
eyes from his, and shake hands with quaint formality,
and ask how he carried himself. If she had changed any
particular of it he would have been alarmed, would have
felt a sense of loss.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert and Madeleine will meet us here,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well.” She smiled and nodded. “You have been
at the front?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are ver’ <i>fatigué</i> perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. I had a bully night’s sleep, and I’m ready for
anything. We must have a regular party to-day. We’ll
paint the town and all the suburbs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, so ver’ fast. I do not onderstan’.... I do not
onderstan’. You mus’ speak more slow.... Give me
the <i>dictionnaire</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was nothing.... Are you happy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you not here?” she said, gravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was something so timid, yet so confident about
her, so gentle, so child-womanly, that the realization of it
struck Kendall almost with the force of an accusation....
It was the forerunner of self-accusation which might
have come then and there, had not Bert and Madeleine
turned the corner and waved to them. Immediately
the girls were chattering French, after their inevitable
formal handshake.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where to, children?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>They turned to the girls. “Where are we going?” Ken
asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, out of the city. Let us go to the Bois—for the
long day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Oui</i>,” agreed Madeleine. “The Bois—every one—<i>tout
le monde</i>—make themselves to go to the Bois.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So, after some difficulty, they persuaded the driver of a
<i>voiture</i> to drive them up the Champs Élysées and the
length of the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne to the gates of
the park. There the <i>cocher</i> drew up to the curb inexorably
and stopped without paying the least attention to the
protests of the Americans.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We must get down,” said Andree. “He cannot go
inside.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But there are <i>voitures</i> inside—lots of them. Why
can’t he go in?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She shrugged her shoulders, but arose, and Madeleine
followed her. They knew the way of the Paris coachmen—or
it may have been a rule, or an agreement for the
division of patronage. At any rate, they got down and
paid the absurdly low fare. Then, walking two by two,
they entered the famous park.</p>

<p class='c006'>The walks near the entrance were crowded, but as they
penetrated the city’s playground the congestion became
less dense. But it did seem as if Madeleine were right,
that all the world had come to the Bois that day. Every
seat, and they were scattered about generously, was occupied.
Back among the trees family parties had preempted
shady glades and were spreading lunches. Buxom
young women played battledore with <i>poilus</i> on permission,
or engaged in what they seriously believed to be
tennis with the most profound earnestness. This tennis
delighted Bert, who insisted upon stopping to watch
more than one game. The players had no nets—only
rackets and a ball. With these they placed themselves
sometimes as much as twenty feet apart and then lobbed
the ball back and forth with such a seriousness and intensity
that it seemed they were playing for life itself....
Children were everywhere, and stout old ladies who
drowsed and lean old men who had taken off their coats
and were tormented by insects.... Out on the pavements
men and women and children rode furiously by on
bicycles, all crouching apprehensively over their handlebars
and pedaling for dear life.... Youths in French
uniforms made vigorous and unashamed love to their
sweethearts.... It was very hot.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few minutes’ walk brought them to the lake, steaming
with the heat of the day, its surface churned by the
unskilled oars of pleasure-seekers. On the opposite shore
was a dense crowd packed about a booth, awaiting their
turns to go upon the water and suffer. Two or three huge
<i>bateaux</i> capable of seating a score of people made little
voyages up and down, each propelled by one sweating,
coatless individual who pulled the enormous weight at such
terrific speed that a circuit of the pond might have been
made in an hour. The passengers sat packed together in
blissful enjoyment.... Those who took rowboats
seemed to have a positive genius for loading them in
such a way as to make them unmanageable. In the middle
was an elderly man, very stout, with two young girls.
One girl rowed while her companions sat as far into the
bow as possible, lifting the stern high in the air, and
making any progress except a sort of whirligig motion
impossible. There were collisions, shouts, laughter,
screams—and an intolerable heat. But the crowd was
happy as only a Parisian crowd can be happy. They had
not the least fear of making themselves appear absurd;
they went about their pleasure in a determined, do-or-die
spirit, and everybody was so satisfied, so happy, so
charming that Ken was delighted and tried to tell Andree
how pleased he was by aid of French, English, and the
dictionary, but only succeeding in bewildering the young
lady utterly.... He had a suspicion that both Andree
and Madeleine looked at those boats longingly, but
with characteristic American terror of making himself
look ridiculous he would not have gone upon that
water if they had fallen on their knees to plead with
him....</p>

<p class='c006'>After a time they managed by bribery and cajolery to
persuade a <i>cocher</i> to drive them about the park and an
hour or two later got down near to a toy railroad with a
tiny engine which pulled crowded trains along a child’s
track. Bert, whose inhibitions were less pronounced than
Ken’s, insisted upon riding. The girls boarded the train
as a matter of course, with no trace of self-consciousness,
but as they bowled along past crowds that waved and
pointed and laughed, Ken felt like the father of all idiots....
Finally they arrived at the zoo, which Andree insisted
upon inspecting.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cages in the zoo which attracted the crowds contained
dogs! Indeed, dogs were the backbone and almost
the sum total of the animals to be seen. They were caged
like bears and ran around and around behind their iron
bars with the ceaseless gait of wolves. It rather revolted
Kendall, especially to see a beautiful English setter in
such an environment. There were setters, Danes, bulls,
fox-terriers—and the crowds stood and stared and gasped
and exclaimed as if they gazed at the behemoth of Holy
Writ....</p>

<p class='c006'>But it was all fascinating to Ken, all different and
strange. Here was France again! He was seeing something
foreign, not of the Middle West, and it was droll
and incomprehensible to him. He did not speculate on
what your Frenchman might have thought of a Sunday
crowd at Coney Island or the Bronx Zoo or in Belle Isle
Park in his own Detroit.... He reveled in it, drinking
in eagerly the sensation that he was in another world
peopled by incomprehensible beings who functioned in an
incomprehensible manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here at least was none of the depression and woe of
war.... Had it not been for the presence of uniforms,
one would have forgotten war. Ken wondered if these
people had been able to forget it—and then reflected that
some of these that he saw might be killed before another
dawn by bombs dropped upon their sleeping homes from
ruthless German aeroplanes.... All was lightness and
joyousness now; in a few hours every individual here might
be cowering in a cellar, damp with the sweat of fear of
imminent slaughter....</p>

<p class='c006'>They dined expensively at a table under the trees and
near to a fountain, and Andree exclaimed at the extravagance
of it and declared that for days to come they
must satisfy their hunger on bread and water.... They
were very gay and very young. For that one day all
cares and apprehensions had taken flight; they simply did
what occurred to them, and the word <i>responsibility</i> was
scratched from their vocabularies.</p>

<p class='c006'>After a time they found a pleasant spot among the
trees and sat down to rest, for such a day is very tiring.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thees day has been ver’ well,” said Andree, nodding
her head three times by way of punctuation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish all days were like it,” Madeleine said in French.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree regarded her gravely a moment, then shook her
head emphatically. “No. It would not be well. The
days like thees day are ver’ nice bicause they are seldom.
To-day is for nothing but only happiness—yes. But it is
not possible to be so happy to-day if we are not ver’
unhappy some other day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you think that unhappiness makes happiness?”
said Bert, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But yes, monsieur. If there is not sadness there is no
joy. It is of a truthfulness. <i>Certainement.</i> How do you
know you are happy? It is bicause you theenk of days
when you are ver’ miserable, and thees day is so different
from that day. If all days shall be like to-day, then we
shall be—how do you say?—we shall be bored.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But if one is very miserable after he has been happy?”
said Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree looked at him quickly as if trying to penetrate
to the thought that prompted the question.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well,” she said, softly. “On the unhappy day
you theenk often of the happy day—it makes the unhappiness
to be less. After many, many days one may
forget the unhappiness. The good God has made it a
law. The sorrow it becomes not so sharp. Even the ver’
greatest grief becomes jus’ a theeng to be remembered.
But a happiness! Oh, my friend, that live forever. A
happiness cannot be made to fade. Always it live and
always it is ver’ beautiful and makes itself to give other
happiness.... That is why,” she said, softly, to Ken,
“that I have not great fear to love you. Do you see?...
W’en it is ended, thees love of ours, it will be ver’
sad, but the sadness it will become soft and make itself
to fade after many year. The happiness, such happiness
as thees ver’ day, it will be always....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But,” said Ken, suddenly depressed and thoughtful,
“isn’t there a sorrow so great that it cannot be endured?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh yes, yes! But that is terrible. I have thought
many times of such a sorrow. There is only one like that.
It is to love ver’ much and trust ver’ much and be ver’
much happy, and then, one day, to know that one has
been deceive’ entirely. To know that the friend one
love’ was on’y making to pretend and did not himself
love.... That one could not bear.... Then all the
little moments of happiness with him would make themselves
to be black and wicked ... and one must die....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall lifted her hand and touched it with his lips
and looked into her eyes. “I do not know what will
come, <i>mignonne</i> ... but whatever does come, it must
not be that.... See, I am speaking the truth so that
you may remember it always.... I love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>For a moment she returned his gaze gravely, then into
her dark-shadowed eyes came a glow that was real happiness,
her lips smiled and she leaned a little toward him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I believe,” she said, softly, “and it is ver’ well....”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall had paid little attention to Andree’s
assertion that she had seen Maude Knox in Paris,
yet on Monday he received a <i>petit bleu</i> from her informing
him that she was again at the Hôtel Wagram and would
be delighted to have him call that evening if he were free.
At his first reading of the note Maude Knox seemed to
him an intrusion. Somehow be rather resented her
existence because, subconsciously, he knew that association
with her was going to be disquieting. It would give
rise to argument within himself and to speculations upon
the future which he would have liked to avoid. He was
satisfied and as happy as he had ever been in his life—and
Maude was a complication. If Maude Knox had
been less important in his life he would have welcomed
her more heartily.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, as he thought more and more of her presence,
he found himself desiring greatly to see her. There was
something sympathetic and dependable about her, something
that he could understand and approve. She was
American, thoroughly American. Yes, by all means, he
wished to see her, but he would hold himself in restraint.
They should not become at all personal, and he would
watch the conversation carefully to see that it did not turn
any unexpected corners or wander down lanes ending in
disagreeable obstacles to be cleared.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be decent to her,”
he told himself, speciously. “She’s probably lonesome,
and we are both Americans....” He remembered the
hour or so he had spent with her in Montreuil, and how
he had come away from her in a state of perplexity, wondering
if it were possible for a man to love two women
at the same time.... “It isn’t that,” he told himself.
“I love Andree and nobody but Andree ... but that’s
no reason I shouldn’t see Maude. Anyhow, she’ll be
here only a day or so....”</p>

<p class='c006'>The truth of the matter was that, without realizing it,
Kendall did not trust himself. He was afraid that a
thing might happen which he was in a queer sort of way
half willing should happen—that he might fall in love
with Maude Knox or that he might realize in her presence
that he actually was in love with her. It was a singular
position. Undoubtedly he loved Andree—but how?
That he did not ask himself. He loved her, he had a sort
of reverence for her, and he had besides a real friendship
for her, but—He would inevitably have reached that <i>but</i>
if he had allowed himself to analyze his love for her....
A man may have one child and love it with a love which
he fancies is boundless and exclusive. He may believe
that every fraction of the love he has to give belongs to
that child, and he may resent the coming of a second
child and look upon it as an interloper. But very shortly
he finds himself loving the new-comer not one whit
less than the first-born.... If love can become miraculous
in this manner—inexhaustible like the loaves and fishes—with
respect to children, cannot it be the same with
respect to women? Kendall had seen the first develop
in the case of a friend, had heard the friend speak in confidence
before the coming of his second child, and had
observed him after the passage of a few weeks. He took
it as the basis of an argument and, using it as a stepping-stone,
reached a conclusion which was disturbing ...
but not lacking in a certain allurement.... And what
of countries where there are plural marriages? How in
the case of a man lawfully possessed of more than one
wife? Does such a man love all, or only one, or none?...</p>

<p class='c006'>It was in this uncertain frame of mind that he went to
the Wagram and called Maude Knox’s room on the
rather difficult house telephone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Captain Ware!...” said her voice. “I hardly expected
you, but it’s good of you to have come. I’ll be
right down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She appeared presently, not in her uniform, but in such
a dress as she might have worn at home in America when
going out for the evening with a young gentleman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are you doing in Paris?” he demanded. “I
thought you were busy being the queen of the doughboys.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The division’s being moved, I don’t know where, and
I was sent in to wait for orders. Some of our men marched
on the Fourth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose it seems good to get back into the world
again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anybody can be in Paris,” she said. “I’ve been
having the time of my life—and, really, I think I was some
good. I believe I was. The men liked to have me there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Naturally.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She shrugged her shoulders. “Do I understand that
you are taking me to dinner?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do. Where shall it be?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anywhere, so long as there is food I don’t have to
cook myself.... I’ve been living on things out of cans—except
when the officers’ mess had something particularly
good and sent some over.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It hasn’t hurt you a bit.... You look mighty well.”
He was thinking that she did look very well, indeed. Not
exactly beautiful, but satisfyingly good-looking—the way
he liked to see a girl look. A fellow might be proud to
be seen with her. She showed class....</p>

<p class='c006'>“How about the Continental?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’d like it. I’ve never eaten there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They passed out of the hotel and strolled up the rue de
Rivoli to the rue Royale, and then dodged careless taxi-cabs
to cross the broad avenue which stretched with an
air of pride to the face of the Madeleine. Two or three
American officers were loitering about the entrance to the
Continental, and Ken experienced a sense of satisfaction
as he became conscious of their surreptitious stares of
admiration at his companion.... They traversed the
court and entered the big dining-room which stretched
along the rue de Rivoli and through whose windows one
may look out upon the Place de la Concorde and across
the river to the Palais Legislatif. The occupants of the
room were mostly Americans—officers, officials of the Red
Cross, and women of that organization and the Y. M. C. A.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What have you been doing? Tell me all the news,”
Maude said, as they seated themselves at a table close
to the windows.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I?... Working as usual, and there isn’t any news.
Never come to the war if you want news of the war.
I knew a lot more about it when I was back in Detroit
than I do in Paris.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Our division was full of rumors of a big American
offensive.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And Paris is full of rumors of a big German offensive.
It was to have started on the fourth of July, but now it
has been postponed to the fourteenth—Bastille Day....
You can hear anything.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think something is going to happen. The Blue
Devils are up the other side of Meaux. I’ve seen them.
Everybody tells me their presence is a sign that something
is going to happen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Frankly, I don’t believe it. If anything comes I
think it will be a German attack. I don’t look for the
Allies to do much before spring—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When our aeroplanes get here?” she interjected.
“My! but our boys have grumbled about aeroplanes.
It makes them irritable to see German planes buzzing
around.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t blame them. There are rumors about aeroplanes,
too. A <i>poilu</i> asked me the other day if it was
true that we had twenty thousand of them over here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The conversation was following a matter-of-fact, commonplace,
impersonal lane—just such a way as Ken had
determined it should follow. Yet he was dissatisfied with
it. He felt that it lacked something, and that, consequently,
Maude and himself were not getting the most out
of each other’s company. He had resolved not to talk
about himself nor about Maude nor about the sentiments
they inspired in each other, but he found himself wanting
to do so. The staple, as well as the most absorbing,
topic for any young person is himself. It becomes
doubly absorbing if two young persons can join and discuss
<i>themselves</i> and their reactions to each other....
Maude seemed a trifle bored, he thought. Then, suddenly
and with a touch of impatience, she said:</p>

<p class='c006'>“What has been happening to <i>you</i>?... And that
pretty little girl? What was her name?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She, too, seemed to desire to alter the character of the
conversation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing had been happening to him—at least that he
could tell her about. He insisted that life had been a
dull affair of work and sleep for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nonsense! I’m interested.... Oh, I remember her
name—it was Andree. Tell me about Andree.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’s a mighty nice little girl. I see her every now
and then.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Every now and then,” she mocked. “When did you
see her last?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And before that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was away for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you saw her the night before you went away?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And if I hadn’t interfered you’d have seen her to-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No—we had no engagement for to-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed. “You’re not especially subtle. Are you
really in love with this girl?... Do tell me all about
her. I know I’m prying and curious—but—Oh, I’m just
curious about her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—there’s nothing to tell.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There must be. How is she different from us American
girls? She seemed very attractive—and sweet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She says the difference between French and American
girls is that you don’t know how to dress your feet,” he
said, with an uneasy laugh. It rather pleased him that
Maude looked blank an instant and then made an evident
effort to look at her footgear. “Do you want to go to
the Casino or some other place to-night?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not until I’ve found out more about your friend.
You know I liked her looks very much.... Why can’t
I meet her? She wouldn’t be jealous, would she? You
did introduce her, you know. Can’t we have a little
party—the three of us?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” he said, with flat finality in his voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He did not want to reply, did not know what to reply.
The reason that he did not even want to put into definite
thought was that Maude ought not to meet Andree—because
Andree was to him what she was.... Maude
was an American girl, a compatriot living under the laws
of the Medes and the Persians, and it would not be proper
for her to associate with Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?” she repeated. “You said she was <i>nice</i>.” She
accented the <i>nice</i>. “If you don’t let me meet her I shall
think she isn’t nice at all—and a great many other things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is nice,” he said, sullenly. “She’s good....
You wouldn’t understand her. I don’t think I’ve ever
known anybody who was as good as Andree—really good....
But ...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think I understand,” she said, slowly. “It was
really what I wanted to know.” She frowned a trifle and
became thoughtful. Then: “You know I said before
that—that I didn’t blame these girls.... It’s the war—and
their men being killed—and—Well, there’s something
in the air.... I don’t suppose I shall ever understand
them, or be able to see as they see—but I’m—well,
I have a lot of sympathy.... A great many of us are
going to look at things more broadly when we get home to
America. We had never come into contact with other
standards and other ways of trying for happiness....
I know I’m talking in a muddle, but I hope you understand.
What I mean is that I wouldn’t object to meeting
Andree....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In Paris,” said Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In Paris? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you be willing to meet her in New York or
Cleveland or Chicago?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She wrinkled her brows. “Honestly, I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here she would be just one of the sights of France—an
experience. Well, I’m not going to have her on
exhibition, like Notre Dame.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It isn’t that. It isn’t curiosity.... Really, I don’t
know just what it is, but I want to be acquainted with
her. I think it is so I can find out if it is really true
that she—that she can live as she does and still be—<i>nice</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I tell you she is nice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you are in love with her? Aren’t you in love
with her? Somehow that makes a difference. It would
seem sordid and inexcusable if you weren’t.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am very fond of her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you <i>love her</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” he said, desperately.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was just picking up her fork. At his words it
dropped and her lips compressed, but he did not notice.
Perhaps he would have attached no significance to these
signals if he had noticed, because he was fully occupied
in thinking about himself. He had never taken time to
consider Maude Knox’s possible feelings toward himself,
although he had more than once tried in an inconclusive
way to assay his own sentiments toward Maude. Not
that he was exceptionally selfish or self-centered. He
was only at that stage in his relations with Maude when
he was trying to make out what those relations might
develop into. Until a young man is fairly sure he wants
a young woman very much he does not start to worry
about whether she will want him.</p>

<p class='c006'>And Maude ... she had advanced a trifle farther
than Ken, perhaps. Ken had attracted her from the first,
and, peculiarly enough, the rather open mystery of his
affair with Andree had made him a more striking figure,
if not more desirable. It had accented him.... She
had never confessed to herself that she wanted to establish
proprietary rights in Ken, but she did realize that he was
of some importance to her. He was the one individual
in Paris that she had been anxious to see. When she
had been ordered to Paris her first thought had been
that she would see Ken. These things were only indicative.
They proved nothing to her.... But when she
heard Ken baldly admit that he loved Andree she was
close to proof. Undoubtedly it had been a shock and
an unpleasant shock. Ken was more important to her
than she had supposed. She was glad that the waiter
appeared at that moment with the <i>viande</i>, for it gave her
an excuse for silence and attention to her plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>She wondered if this feeling were jealousy.... Then
she repeated to herself, “He loves this girl,” and refused
to believe it, and then was doubtful, and then was afraid....
Other aspects of the affair did not present themselves
to her then—only the fact that this man, who might
have been, whom she wanted to be, something to her, was
in love with another woman, an alien, a Frenchwoman.
Then she asserted to herself, “It’s only an affair....”
There was some comfort and promise in this.</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked up suddenly. “What are you going to do,
Ken?” she asked. “Are you going to marry her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He stammered, hesitated. This was very disquieting.
She had no right to ask such a question. “I—I’ve never
thought about marriage—in connection with Andree,”
he said. He was almost honest in his statement. They
two had been living in the present, had eaten of the lotus,
and the future was only a vague time that might have to
be faced when it arrived. He had been living in a world
which was not a world of reality. It had been a species
of imaginary world into which practical matters like
marriage do not obtrude.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t think of—of settling in France? I hear
some of the men say they want to.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.” He was certain of that. America was his
home, and the homing instinct was strong in him. He
was a citizen of the United States, and it seemed unnatural
and impossible for him to give up that citizenship.
To do so appeared to him to be in the same category as
divorcing a wife, a thing which seemed incredible to him.
But to leave America permanently, to become a citizen
of some other country, seemed more impossible than
divorce. It was simply an act so absurd as to be beyond
consideration. This was not patriotism, but a habit of
mind. He was an American, and it was a natural impossibility
to become anything else—that was it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, if you married her, you would take her home?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s not talk about it,” he said, uncomfortably, for
this opened up a field of disagreeable apprehensions that
he did not want to undertake. “We’re talking too much
about me. Let’s talk about something else.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I want to talk about you.... I’m afraid—afraid
you’re getting into an entanglement that will be—a
bad thing for you.... If you do marry this girl and
take her home, what will your people say? How will your
friends receive her?... Because the story would leak
out. It would be sure to leak out. People know about
you. Your chum knows, and others know....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Andree is good,” he said, “and it doesn’t make any
difference what people think.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not in Paris. But in America it would make a lot of
difference.... She would be whispered about and talked
about—and people might—might refuse to receive her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was angry now. “People are rotten and narrow.
Andree is better than all of them put together. What
do I care for what they say or think?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You would care a great deal—and so would she.
She would soon find out what people were thinking. Here
she may be able to go along and believe that she is not
doing anything wrong. Mind, I don’t say she is bad.
I’m almost able to sympathize with her. If I weren’t
your friend, if I didn’t know you, and this were all happening
to a stranger, I’m sure I should be able to understand
and not to blame her.... As it is, I’m truly sorry
for her.... But I do know you, and that makes it seem
different. Things are always different when they strike
close to home....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, she would find herself in a different world, a
world that lives in a different way, and that world would
make her feel as if she had done wrong, and she would
be very unhappy....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t believe it. Not if I were with her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you—when you get home <i>you</i> will think differently
about this.... You wouldn’t marry an American
girl who had—done as Andree has done.... Would
you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He thought briefly. “No,” he said, honestly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So, if you married her, you would begin to think
about that some day.... You would.... And you
would wonder what she had done before she met you—if—if
you had been the only man she ever loved. Don’t
you see?...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t see. I know her. You don’t know her
at all. You don’t know how sweet and gentle and
decent she is. You don’t know how she thinks....
She is wonderful....” He was loyal, at least, and
she could not help being glad of it. Loyalty was a
quality she especially admired.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She may be all of that, Ken, but it wouldn’t matter.
Other people wouldn’t know it and wouldn’t believe it....
Your mother ...”</p>

<p class='c006'>His mother!... He knew what his mother would
think and what his mother would do. If he took Andree
home his mother would be suspicious of her because she
was French. Then, if the story should leak out, or a
hint of it should be sent to do its slinking work, his mother
would hate Andree—no less. She would make it her
business to eliminate Andree and to render her life
unendurable.</p>

<p class='c006'>With unconscious strategy he made a counterattack.
“And you,” he said, “would you marry a man who had—had
that sort of an experience?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked up at him suddenly to determine if there were
anything personal in this question, but could not make
up her mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I don’t know.... I—I’ve never imagined—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course not.... But you might have to imagine
it. Suppose you were in love with a man—suppose you
were in love with me”—she concealed a gasp at his
clumsiness—“would you marry me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She tried to protect herself, and said, with a forced
laugh, “Am I to consider this as a proposal?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He disregarded her flippancy. “I suppose I shall
marry some day, and if it isn’t Andree—if it is some
American girl like you—what will she think? I want to
know. You have asked me a lot of questions, and that
sort of gives me the right to ask you this one: Would
you marry me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t answer—now. I don’t know.... I don’t
think so.... I should have to think....”</p>

<p class='c006'>He regarded her. Mentally he paid her the compliment
of thinking that she was a splendid type. He
could not help thinking that she was just such a girl as
he would like to marry and to live with always. She
exerted an attraction that drew him toward her strongly....
A wife! She would be a splendid wife, a wife that
his mother would receive joyfully, about whom there
could not be the slightest question.... He wondered if
she liked him at all—and that was a sign and a portent.
Suddenly the answer to her question became of large
importance to him. He leaned over the table and looked
into her eyes—and saw her cheeks color under his gaze.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish you would think,” he said, slowly, “and tell me
what you think—” Then he added something he had
not at all intended to say: “And tell me if it is possible
for a man to love two girls at the same time....”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall Ware leaned out of a window of the
apartment, looking down at the avenue beneath.
He had an unobstructed view of the sidewalk as far as the
corner. It was time for Andree to arrive, and he was
watching for her. Taxicabs rattled past, a huge <i>camion</i>
manufactured in America and driven by an American
rumbled along; a French officer, resplendent with gold
braid and medals and red trousers, walked by gaily, a
beautiful woman on each side; the <i>concierge</i> was sweeping
the sidewalk in front of the entrance; a child or two in
the inevitable black outer garment or smock played near
a bench ... and then came Andree. She was all in
white, as he loved to see her best. Perhaps it was because
she had been all in white when he saw her for the
first time. She looked very tiny from his place four
stories above the street, and he watched her with something
of the tender amusement with which one watches
a child when it is unconscious of one’s presence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree approached in a determined, business-like
manner. One could tell at once that she had a destination
in view. The quaint stiffness of her gait was accentuated
by the angle from which he looked at her, as was her
slenderness. He watched to see if she would turn her
head or allow her eyes to vary from that intent, straight-ahead
gaze which seemed to see nothing. They did not
vary. She was prim. Prim was the word, he thought....
The white tam was jaunty, but it did not give her
an air of jauntiness; instead of doing so it gave quite
another impression—that of inexperienced youth, youth
untouched by the events of life, youth that had yet to
come to a knowledge that there was evil in the world.
That was a great deal for a tam-o’-shanter to tell, but
somehow it managed to tell it. Ken leaned farther out
to watch her as she came directly underneath, wondering
if she would glance up at the windows.</p>

<p class='c006'>She did glance upward, suddenly, as if something had
fallen at her feet and startled her. She saw Ken, but she
neither smiled nor waved, and dropped her eyes again as
quickly as she had raised them. But there was about
her then an air of relief, as if she had sighed audibly....
He was there waiting for her eagerly; she had seen it, and
her apprehensions, if she had any, were quieted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken listened for her step upon the stairs, but heard no
sound until the door-bell rang with a sort of tentative,
hesitating ring. It seemed as if she could touch nothing
without imparting some character, something of her mood
of the moment.... He opened the door and she raised
her eyes to his and looked into his face a moment, her
face perfectly immobile. She stood very straight and still,
her arms stiffly at her sides.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dear,” he said, and held out his arms to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>She smiled shyly, diffidently, as she allowed him to take
her in his arms and kiss her. She was not responsive,
but seemed rather speculative.... As if she were allowing
this thing to happen to see if it were really going to
happen.... And then she returned his kiss gravely,
as much as to say: “Yes, this can really happen. It is
so. I am much relieved.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are <i>triste</i>,” he said, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mais non.... Mais non....</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then smile.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When I have climb’ many stairs I cannot smile....
But I am glad.... Who is here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nobody.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not Arlette?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh yes, of course. But Bert won’t be home to
dinner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well.... <i>Non, non</i>, you mus’ not take my <i>sac</i>.
It is ver’ valuable—yes. I mus’ watch it ver’ careful.
It has my tickets of the bread.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll hang it right here, and your jacket, or whatever
you call it.... What have you been doing?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have work <i>beaucoup</i>. Oh, it is ver’ tiresome to work!
It is much better jus’ to play all the days.... And you?
Have you theenk of me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not believe—no, no, not once have you theenk
of me. You are ver’ wicked—<i>très-méchante</i>. I shall to
weep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think of you when I wake up, all the morning, at
noon, all the afternoon—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non, non, non!...</i>” She was laughing now.
“Maybe one leetle theenk—only. But I—oh, I have
theenk of you ver’ much. I have theenk you are <i>pas
fidèle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I!... Not faithful!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.” She nodded her head decidedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why do you say that? You know I am <i>fidèle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have see’ you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Seen me—where?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, you are ver’ wicked.... You deceive me mos’
cruel.” He could not tell if she were serious or if she
were teasing him. “Also I am mos’ <i>jalouse</i>. It is thees
yo’ng girl—thees yo’ng American girl. I have see’ you
with her las’ night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh yes. We had dinner together. She has just come
back to Paris for a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh yes,” she mimicked. “I know thees leetle dinner.
She tries to steal you away from me.... You like her
more than me. It is so. I see it.... I shall take me
a dagger and make her to die—so.” She laughed gaily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t really believe I’m unfaithful at all. You’re
just making fun of me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you bring her <i>here</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eh?... What’s that? Here? Maude Knox here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And why not? Since you are not <i>fidèle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you don’t understand. Maude Knox is an
American girl. She wouldn’t—I couldn’t—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, it is so?... Then these American girls, they do
not love. They are stone or wood, is it so?... I do not
onderstan’ these American girls.” She was delightfully
disgusted. “Sometime I shall cross the ocean to observe
these girls. It will be ver’ droll. America mus’ be a
ver’ droll, ver’ serious country—where the girls do not
love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They do love. Of course they love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, then, Why do you make such astonishment when
I speak that she comes here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He waggled his hand helplessly, and she, perceiving
that she was teasing him, put on greater pretense of
seriousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, I see,” she said. “The American girl she say,
‘I love,’ and then she enter into the convent.... She
goes in the <i>jardin</i> and see the bud about to blossom, and
she cover it weeth a veil. Is it not? Oh, such love as
thees! It is the love of the ice for the snow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s different, Andree. I can’t explain it to you
because I can’t explain it to myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pouf!</i> Different! Do you theenk I cannot perceive
it is different? Oh yes, monsieur. I perceive ver’ clearly
... the difference between alive and dead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re wrong. American girls can love—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How do you know?” she interrupted, impishly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“—can love,” he persisted, “but all nice American girls
marry—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To be sure. Ah, marriage—that is ver’ well. There
is nothing against marriage. Not in the least. Many
people marry, and it is ver’ well. Why not?...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never can make you understand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nevair.... I cannot to onderstan’ what is not
natural. Do you onderstan’ if you see the river ron up
the hill? <i>Mais non.</i> To love is to love; to marry is to
marry. It is not the same theeng altogether....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“America is different.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have say that bifore.... It mus’ be the fault of
the girls. <i>Oui....</i> So far as I observe the men they
are willing enough.... Perhaps they are so willing
bicause at America they are always denied. It is mos’
fortunate for them they come to Paris. Otherwise they
would die and not ever have been alive at all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re a dear child and I love you and I almost
understand what you’re talking about. But you could
never understand America—and sometimes I’m glad of
it.... And America never will be able to understand
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What would Americans theenk of me if I come to
New York?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They would think you were very lovely.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not mean <i>that</i>. I am not lovely. I am ver’
hideous. See, I cover my face bicause you are afraid.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s not bother about America—just about us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I am <i>jalouse</i>. I hate thees American yo’ng girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fiddlesticks!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“For all you say, I theenk she come here las’ night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, look here—”</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed gaily and ran to the window. “See, I
shall jump down and die.... <i>Bon soir</i>, Arlette....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Bon soir, mademoiselle. Dîner est servi.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well.... How does your little granddaughter
carry herself?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very well, mademoiselle. Even now she is in the
kitchen and very impatient to visit you and Monsieur
Ken.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She must dine weeth us, mus’ she not, <i>cher ami</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course. Set a place for her, Arlette. And tell her
we shall have some American cakes that I got at the
commissary store.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette beamed with pride and satisfaction and padded
about, setting a third place at the table, waggling her
head and whispering to herself as she went. Ken and
Andree seated themselves, and then Arlette appeared in
the door with little Arlette concealed among her skirts.
The tiny head, with its birdlike features, peeped out at
them timorously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Enter, mademoiselle,” said Andree. “See, she has
eyes only for Monsieur Ken, is it not? She is my rival....
I shall not dine weeth her. She is ver’ bad and
wicked.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette pushed her granddaughter ahead of her, muttering
to her in French.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Bon soir, monsieur. Bon soir, mademoiselle</i>,” she said
in a tiny voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arlette!” prompted her grandmother, and set her head
on one side and made her eyes very large and round
while she awaited the result of her prompting. Little
Arlette looked at her grandmother, then at Ken and
Andree in turn, and said, with the most comical manner of
pride in achievement, “Goo’-by, gent’men.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh,” exclaimed Andree, “she has learned English to
make me sad! With these accomplishments she will make
short work of me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken lifted the child into her place and tilted her delicate,
fragile, fairy face upward. “You shall give me a kiss and
make her very jealous,” he said, whereupon she kissed
him, keeping one eye on Andree to observe results, and
was much gratified to see her rival cover her face with
her hands to hide her grief.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I go to America with him,” she said to Andree. “I do
not know if it is America of the North or America of the
South. It does not matter. I am to be his wife.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, already you are American,” said Andree, slyly.
“You theenk only of marry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And we shall live in a toy-shop and eat nothing but
candy,” said Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Americans are very rich,” observed little Arlette.
“My grandmother has told it to me—and that I must
teach my husband that it is wicked to be careless with
one’s money.... We shall not dine upon pullet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see what it is to marry,” said Andree. “Already
you are denied what you desire.... I theenk mademoiselle
makes a marriage of money.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not a marriage of money, is it, <i>mignonne</i>? No. It
is for true love you marry me, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh yes, yes! I love monsieur very much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what is to become of me? I, too, love monsieur
ver’ much,” said Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette observed her gravely and pondered. “You,
too, shall be his wife, mademoiselle,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah ... it seems I was wrong. After all, little
Arlette is not wholly American.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The dinner was finished and Ken carried little Arlette
into the <i>salon</i> on his shoulder. She cuddled between him
and Andree on the sofa, insisted upon holding his hand,
and looked at Andree with calculating eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you no new <i>chansons, petite</i>?” asked Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>” And she stood up with a most
serious air, taking her position just so and smoothing
down her skirts. Then she tilted up her little chin and,
with her eyes fixed gravely on Ken’s face, she sang a song
of many verses while her grandmother stood in the door
and bobbed and grinned and made signs of a great satisfaction....
It was not like a child singing, Ken thought,
but like some playfellow of elves and fairies. There were
about her a daintiness, an ethereal quality, a purity which
was something more than merely human and of the
flesh.... He wondered what life held for her; wondered
if Andree might not have been just such a child with
just such characteristics as she. He thought it possible
... for Andree retained some of those characteristics
even now.</p>

<p class='c006'>He lifted the child in his arms and kissed her, and
Arlette took her away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must come often,” Ken said, “because we are to
be married.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, monsieur. That is understood.... It was
America of the North, was it not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall remember.... <i>Bon soir, monsieur. Bon soir,
mademoiselle.</i>” And she was gone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have many rivals,” said Andree. “It is not well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is only one <i>you, mignonne</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But yes, there is only one <i>me</i>, but there are many
others. Little Arlette, thees yo’ng American girl.... I
wish to know thees yo’ng American girl. I will meet her.”
She nodded her head several times. “You will have her
come here or we shall dine together.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing doing!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, what is thees you say? I do not onderstan’.
Give me the <i>dictionnaire</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The dictionary won’t help. I mean I won’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There you are again. <i>Pourquoi.... Toujours pourquoi.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well to ask why many times. If one does not
ask why, then many unpleasant theengs may happen. If
one asks why—then one knows and can weigh the results.
<i>N’est-ce pas?</i> I like to know where I am marching.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t want you to meet Miss Knox, because you
would not understand each other at all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I theenk we would. But I shall meet her jus’ the same.
... She is the kind of girl Americans marry. I wish to
study why.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She would be studying you, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She shrugged her shoulders. “Of course. One woman
always studies another. It is natural.... I do not
know why, unless it is to determine if the woman can
take one’s lover away, or if one can take the woman’s
lover away from her.... I theenk that is it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But suppose you didn’t want the woman’s lover?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is of no importance. It is still ver’ well to be
able to say to oneself that it would be possible to take that
woman’s lover if it was desired.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“1 don’t like to hear you talk like that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>” Andree’s eyes were big with surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It doesn’t sound nice.... It sounds—oh, it doesn’t
sound like <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She put her cheek against his. “Then I will not say it if
you do not like.... I do not want any other man. I
want only you.... Do you love me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I do not believe. You love this yo’ng American
girl because she theenks only of marry.... You will
marry thees yo’ng girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m not going to marry anybody.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Americans always do. It is the law of the country.
You have said it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know I love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am afraid bicause of thees yo’ng girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nonsense. I can’t marry anybody, Andree. All I
have in the world is my captain’s pay. Nobody can tell
how long the war will last, nor how long I will be held in
the service after it is over—and when I am discharged ...
well, what then? I don’t know. There’s nothing to look
forward to but war ... just this and nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She stroked his hand reflectively. “It is well,” she said,
after a moment. “While there is war you shall be here.
We shall theenk of nothing else.... <i>Après la guerre</i>”—she
made a little gesture with both hands—“then we shall
see.... I theenk you will be <i>fidèle</i> w’ile it is that you
remain in France. I am satisfy—for now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t believe I love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She mused, and then with that characteristic gesture of
poking downward with her index finger she said: “I
theenk many things. I theenk that I know jus’ one
kind of love, and it ees <i>love</i>, it ees for all time and for all
thing’. It ees for marry or for not marry. But I theenk
you have two kinds of love—<i>oui</i>. Perhaps it ees <i>américain</i>—the
custom of the country. One love for pleasure
and—how do you say?—one love for business....
Listen, my friend. Do the pleasure love and the business
love never come at the same time and for the same yo’ng
girl? Eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have never loved anybody but you.” He paused.
“You know all about such things, <i>mignonne</i>. Is it possible
for a woman to love two men at the same time—or for a
man to love two women at the same time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed. “It ees the las’ half of the question you
wish for to have answer.... I theenk it ees different
weeth man and woman. The woman she love only one.
She give all.... The man—maybe. It ees ver’ difficult.
But I theenk if there ees one large love that it ees
all.... And I theenk, Monsieur Ken, that one day
you go away and leave me <i>solitaire</i>. Oh, I shall to weep.”
She clenched her fists and dug them into her eyes, and
then laughed up at him. “See, I am ver’ <i>triste</i>.... You
mus’ make me to be joyous.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was right, he thought. There could be but one
love, one great love. How could he think otherwise, for
was she not there, close beside him, her breath upon his
cheek, her wonderful eyes turning up to his face every
now and then with that inquiring, wondering, speculating
glance that spoke to his heart? ... One love, marvelous,
sweet, <i>good</i>. He could even pause to assert its
virtue.... Maude Knox became very dim, intangible.
Andree was here, present, living—in all the mystery of her
and all the foreign allurement.... This was love. This
was an amazing sweetness without which his life would
be immeasurably the poorer. It was a permanent thing—could
not be uprooted at a moment’s notice. He knew
that it had altered, was altering, his whole life, and he was
glad. Whatever might come of it, he was glad....
Something had been given to him which would remain a
miraculous possession so long as light entered his eyes or
reason blossomed in his soul....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Andree,” he said, tremulously. “Andree....”</p>

<p class='c006'>She sighed with content. “I am ver’ happy,” she
replied. “Ever’thing is ver’ well....”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Paris awoke to the 14th of July—Bastille Day—without
knowing that, as it had marked the beginning
of the end of the <i>ancien régime</i>, it was now to mark
the last hour of the peril of France. It was fitting that
this great national fête should bring to an end the days
when the <i>boche</i> was to be feared, and that to-morrow was
to see the beginning of the end. But Paris did not know.
The air was heavy with portent; events impended....
There was present in every heart the apprehension that
the unthinkable might happen, and that their beloved
city might, within a period of days, fall into the hands
of the enemy.... Bastille Day was the last day of the
reign of fear.... The event was still on the knees of
the gods; Paris could not read the future, but it could
make holiday with destruction at its door. The heart of
Paris was steadfast.... Its fortitude was on the eve
of its reward.</p>

<p class='c006'>Paris did not know that to-morrow the boche would
lunge at its throat, throwing a weight into the thrust that
it had never been able to throw before; nor did Paris
know that its armies and its allies would receive that
thrust without faltering, and would hurl upon it such
rain of fire and steel as would crush it to the ground futile
and staggering.... Paris did not know, nor did the
brain of any human being know, that but three days must
pass before that man of infinite patience and courage who
was generalissimo of the forces which barred the path
of the Hun would make his first mighty stride toward
victory, a stride which should become a steady march,
never flagging, never stopping, until his armies should
have won the precious right to march with heads erect
under that great pile which dominates their city—the
Arc de Triomphe.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was such events which impended on this 14th of
July....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall Ware and Andree had chosen the Place des
Ternes as the most advantageous point from which to see
the parade, and though it was raining a trifle when they
started out, with skies which promised a drizzly day,
they were not to be deterred. The little concrete oval
which is the meeting-place of the Boulevard de Courcelles,
the Avenue de Wagram, the Avenue des Ternes, and the
rue du Faubourg St.-Honoré was already crowded.
People splashed about in its shallow puddles and jostled
one another between its flower-booths, which were doing a
thriving business. The parade was already passing with
martial music and amid much clapping of hands, but
less shouting than would have obtained in an American
city.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken edged Andree as near to the street as he could.
For him it was easy to look over the heads of the people
and to see the marching soldiers, but little Andree might
as well have been at home across the river. She could
see nothing, and there was no box nor chair to be had.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shall I lift you up?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mais non.</i> You cannot. I am of such a largeness!...
But I shall see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll sit you on my shoulder and tell folks you are my
granddaughter,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Regardez!</i>” She took a small rectangular mirror from
her <i>sac</i> and held it before his eyes. Then she turned her
back on the parade and, holding the mirror at an angle
above her head, looked into it with quaint intentness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I see!” she exclaimed. “Behol’, the parade it
marches in the glass.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken laughed, but he was a trifle annoyed and embarrassed.
Andree herself, he thought, was so natural, so
herself, that she would have not the least thought in the
world of making herself ridiculous or conspicuous, but
this absurd makeshift of hers would certainly attract
the attention of the crowd—and nobody knew what a
Parisian crowd might do. He hesitated, looked about him
uncomfortably, and decided to hold his peace. It was
well, for within a radius of thirty feet a dozen men and
women were doing exactly as Andree did. They had
come prepared. Each of them stood facing away from
the procession, a mirror held above the heads of the
crowd, and it was with difficulty Kendall restrained his
laughter. Their expressions were all so eager, so interested.
It was absurd. With all that was going on behind
them, they peered as if bewitched into rectangles of glass,
and shouted, or lowered their mirrors to clap their hands
just as if they were seeing living soldiers instead of tiny
reflections....</p>

<p class='c006'>The crowd interested him more than the marching men.
There was a good-natured simplicity, a lack of reserve, a
childishness about them, yet there were a bigness, a pathos,
and a grandeur in their bearing.... Boys and young
men mounted into trees; couples carrying bouquets scurried
up and down the line, seeking a point where they
might penetrate to the street; here was a woman weeping
and smiling at once. She was in black.... And everywhere
flowers! Now and then a girl would run out from
the curb to hand a blossom to some <i>poilu</i> or Italian or
Englishman or Portuguese.... Every French soldier
marched with a smile and with a posy nodding from the
muzzle of his gun. The street was thick with flowers
and the air rained flowers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Americans passed. In their guns were no blossoms,
on their tunics were no bouquets. They marched very
stiffly, erect, business-like, with eyes to the front. The
French had shuffled by jovially with nods and smiles.
One could tell they had seen the war and were marching
men, but there was no stiffness, no rigidity. They were
like the defense of their great general—elastic. The Italians
grinned cheerfully; so did the Portuguese; even the
English were somewhat relaxed—but all these had known
four years of war.... The Americans, marching like
one man, like a splendid machine, seemed, somehow,
sterner, of more warlike stuff. They struck the eye and
won the applause of the multitude.... But they were
of no sterner stuff, nor would they have asserted themselves
to be better fighting-men than the sturdy <i>poilus</i> or
the wiry Tommies.... They were younger—that was
what impressed one. Their youth cried aloud....
Amid those soldiers of France and England and Italy
and Belgium they looked like boys—and yet their age
might not have been greater than these others—for the
others had seen four years of war.... But they were
splendid, these young men from another world, and the
heart of Paris went out to them....</p>

<p class='c006'>A hand touched Kendall’s arm and he turned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Maude!” he exclaimed, and shot a startled
glance toward Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>She had not seen, but was peering into her mirror.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How glad you are to see me!” She laughed. “Really,
I’ve nothing catching. What’s the matter?...” She
glanced about and saw Andree. “Oh!” she said. “I’m
glad. I wanted to know her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I told you—” he began; but it was Andree who
interrupted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Bon jour</i>, Mademoiselle Knox,” she said, gravely.
“We have met one little time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, indeed, and I have wanted so much to meet you
again. I have told Mr. Ware....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I, too, have wanted to know you. I have said it
to him, yes, many times. I have said that I shall to
know thees Miss Maude Knox—but”—she shrugged her
shoulders—“<i>les Américains</i> are droll.... He would
not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He can’t help himself now, can he? Now that we
know we want to be acquainted with each other, there’s
nothing he can do about it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I do not onderstan’. You speak <i>trop vite, mademoiselle</i>.
My English it is of the worst.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And my French is non-existent. But that doesn’t
matter in the least, does it? We shall get on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>For those girls there was now something of much
greater importance than the parade, and they promptly
forgot it. Maude moved over to Andree’s side and they
began the sort of conversation that women use when they
are appraising each other with serious intention. Ken
listened uneasily. There was nothing he could do. This
thing that he had desired not to happen <i>had</i> happened,
and that was all there was to it. He pretended to watch
the parade, but his mind was concentrated on what the
girls were saying. The girls appeared to have forgotten
him as well as the marching men.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken was acutely apprehensive, but of what he was
apprehensive he did not know. The thought that Andree
and Maude were together, chatting, becoming acquainted,
seemed to him very threatening. He had been in a holiday
humor, but that humor was gone. He frowned and was
conscious of both irritation and depression. It was not
right for them to meet. Something was sure to come of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not at all that he felt that Andree was not a fit
companion for Maude Knox. That was not it. He was
not ashamed of Andree, and, strangely enough, when one
considers his temperament and the hereditary impulses
which stirred within him, he was not ashamed of his relations
with her. It was an intangible apprehension, a
feeling that one woman whom he knew he loved and
another woman with whom he might be in love could not
meet without unpleasant results to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was curiosity, too, which grew stronger. More
than once he had compared Andree with Maude Knox
when neither was present, but now they were together,
at his side, under his eyes.... He edged away a trifle
with elaborate unconsciousness, and presently reached a
point from which he could study the girls with covert
glances.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not so much their appearances that he compared
as it was their <i>selves</i> as he knew them, and as they were
indicated by what met the eye. He was trying to arrive
at a knowledge of what each girl meant in his life, what
she could contribute to his life. Perhaps this was wholly
selfish, but choice must ever be selfish. It is after choice
is made that one may be generous and self-denying.</p>

<p class='c006'>The contrast between Andree and Maude was so
extreme that they seemed to have nothing in common but
their sex, and as Ken considered he saw they had not
even this in common. At least their conception of it and
of its duties and possibilities and obligations and uses
were as different as the color of their eyes or the expressions
of their faces. One could not see Andree without
being conscious that she was a woman, of the femininity
of her, and that the chief business of her life was to be the
complement of some man. The first emotion that Andree
excited was tenderness.... As one looked at Maude
Knox his first thought was comradeship, followed by a
mental note that she would be reliable, capable of taking
care of herself. Maude was not beautiful, but she was
pretty, with a clean-cut, boyish prettiness that spoke of
health of mind and of body. She was not the sort a man
would fall in love with at first sight, but rather one who
would first be admired and then loved.... Andree
would be loved first, then admired as the sweetness of herself
unfolded under the urging of love. Andree was
fragile. Ken looked at her lips, perfectly drawn, delicate,
sensitive—her most eloquent feature. They were lips to
kiss, lips to give kisses. There, perhaps, stood the chief
difference between these girls and their attitude toward
life: that Andree would give, give, give—asked no other
happiness but to give of herself and her sweetness and
her tenderness and her love—while Maude would demand
an exchange. She, too, could love, but always there would
be inhibitions and reservations. She would take thought
of practical matters, be efficient in love and marriage.
Not that she would be selfish, Ken felt sure, but that she
would see to it her relations with the man she loved would
be well organized and stabilized. She would be a wife
and a comrade to the man she married, and perhaps a
dominant force; Andree would be wife and sweetheart,
with no thought of dominating, but only of giving, of
adding to the happiness of the man she loved.</p>

<p class='c006'>If love were cruel to Andree, and the man she worshiped
unkind, she would fade silently, withdraw into herself, and
suffer; Maude would have suffered, but she would have
faced the matter and held her own. It would be possible
for Maude to go through life alone; that Andree should
do so was utterly unthinkable. This was, perhaps, because
Andree thought of herself only as a woman, and as
a woman whose life must be bound up with the life of
some man. Maude Knox thought of herself as an
individual, a distinct entity with rights and purposes which
must not be invaded or interfered with.</p>

<p class='c006'>A man might expect help, encouragement, even dynamic
career from Maude Knox. He might expect a wonderful
fidelity from her. She would take an interest in his life
and would want to have a finger in the shaping of his
destiny. Andree would play her part in his life less
obtrusively, but perhaps as powerfully by keeping alive
his love and by lavishing her love upon him. She would
ask nothing, demand nothing except a continuance of
love and a lavishment of tenderness. So long as love
endured she would follow him to the highest success
without taking any great thought of that success, or she
would have descended with him to the depths of failure
without bewailing that failure—for success to her meant
but one thing, and that thing was love.</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude was the ideal wife in a partnership of man and
wife as Americans have come to look upon that relation.
The vestibule of the Presbyterian church would receive
Maude with fulsome compliments and would congratulate
Ken upon making a wise selection. Everybody would
say that he had won a splendid wife ... and it would
be true. She was a typical American wife—that is to say,
she embodied those things which Americans have set
as their ideals of wifehood.... He wondered what the
vestibule would say of Andree, even granting that Andree’s
conception of virtue were the American conception. He
could not imagine, though he could well imagine the stir
she would create. She would be too beautiful—so beautiful
as to excite righteous suspicion. She would be
beautiful in a foreign sort of way, and therefore a sinful
sort of way. The vestibule would never forgive her because
she had lived in Paris and because she did not
pronounce English as well as it did—through its nose.
They would never be able to see into her heart nor to
understand the marvel of her goodness.... She was as
far outside their experience as she was actually outside
Ken’s experience, who studied her hourly, but never
understood her and never would understand her.... She
would always be a mystery and an anomaly to him.
She would always be to him a creature who was guilty
according to his inherited conscience and yet escaped the
accusation or the stain of guilt. She was bad, yet she was
wholly good.</p>

<p class='c006'>He said this to himself, and then hotly denied it.
She was not bad. In his heart he knew she was not bad,
and he knew as well that he had never approached a soul
which was as clean, as unselfish, as purely tender as hers....
Maude Knox was good, too, capable of unselfishness
and fine tenderness. But she could never accomplish what
Andree had accomplished. She could never do as Andree
did and retain her purity.... He did not realize that
this was because Maude herself would have believed
herself to have lost her purity.</p>

<p class='c006'>For Kendall the matter marched back to the attitude
he had absorbed from his mother—that relations between
the sexes were wicked in themselves and could never be
anything else, but that by some miraculous quality belonging
to a formula pronounced by a parson it became
permissible for designated couples to practise wickedness
without fear of punishment. The wickedness remained,
but the formula remitted the punishment. That was his
mother’s belief.... She had been bitterly ashamed when
Kendall became evident, because he was testimony to
the world that she had been guilty....</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken realized that he was getting himself into a state of
mind, that he was reviving those disturbing thoughts
which had such power to make him miserable ... and he
had been very happy with Andree. He had loved his
happiness, and now he wanted it to persist. It had
been something new in his life, very precious, very
wonderful ... and he was not willing that it should
be dimmed.</p>

<p class='c006'>He stepped behind the girls and spoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree turned and smiled. “You shall go away,” she
said. “We do not need you. You shall watch the
parade while Miss Knox and myself make thees ver’
interesting talk. Yes?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are you and Miss Knox talking about?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What should we be talking about?” asked Maude.
“About ourselves, of course.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is ver’ nice subjec’,” said Andree, with an impish
twinkle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me come in. Talk about me, and I’ll listen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pouf!...</i> You! If we talk about you, then you are
ver’ angry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bicause we shall say the truth, and men want only
to be praised. <i>N’est-ce pas?...</i> Oh, all men are greedy
for praise. <i>Oh, là là là là.</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There, Captain Ware. Will you behave now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken laughed. “Andree is always very disagreeable.
I don’t see how I endure her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She nodded. “Yes. I am mos’ disagree-able.” She
accented the last syllable quaintly. “It is bicause I do
not like you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle is very much interested in America,”
said Maude.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And <i>Monsieur le capitaine</i> he tell me so ver’ leetle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“America is a large country. It has a hundred million
of population. The Woolworth Building is sixty stories
high. Everybody owns an automobile and goes to the
movies. Baseball is the national game....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And ever’ man ees marry and ees faithful to his wife,”
interrupted Andree, “and all are ver’ <i>sérieux</i> and mos’
religious, and they are asham’ when they love. I know!
I have study monsieur.” She laughed with childish
gaiety. “Oh, mademoiselle, it mus’ be ver’ droll....
Regard them—they are born, these Americans, they become
ver’ rich, they marry, they die—but they never live.
It is that I believe they are afraid to live....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, mademoiselle,” said Maude, “you have hit on
something there. We are afraid to live, all of us. We
want to live. We want a great happiness, but we are
afraid of it. You can’t understand us better than we
can understand you.... You have learned to live and be
unafraid. We have not learned to get the best out of
life, and our greatest terror is of our neighbors’ tongues....
It has been wonderful for me to come to your
country and to see....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And has mademoiselle really seen?” asked Andree,
her eyes on Maude’s face.</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude hesitated. “I have tried to see, and I think
I have understood a little. I have changed. I am not
the same.... No, I am not the same girl at all who
landed in France a few months ago.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“May one ask what mademoiselle have see’?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude answered, speaking slowly and feeling her way:
“When I left America I thought I was broad-minded
and tolerant. My father had brought me up to be less
narrow-minded than most girls.... He is a professor of
philosophy. But I have found out that I was very narrow-minded
indeed. I could see only one side, and that was
the viewpoint of those among whom I was brought up.
The thing I have come to see is that my home town was
right in setting up its own standards and in maintaining
them—because those standards were best for my home
town.... But I have found out that other towns and
countries have an equal right to set up their own standards
and arrange their own modes of living. I think I can
believe now that a thing which is very wrong in Terre
Haute, Indiana, may be right in Paris or London or
Rome, and that a thing which may be right in Terre
Haute may be wrong in Venice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I onderstan’,” said Andree, gravely. “The theeng you
mean to say is thees, is it not? That an act it become’
wrong when we theenk it is wrong? But if one city theenk
it is right, then it is right for that city? <i>N’est-ce pas?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, something very like that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that an answer to the question I asked you at
dinner a few days ago?” Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree looked at him quickly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude paused a moment before she replied; then she
shook her head. “No,” she said, “that is more complex....
If you were a Parisian I think I could answer, yes,
without hesitation. But you are an American, who,
possibly, should cling to American standards, no matter
where you find yourself.... It is different.... No,
I don’t know what the answer is—yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And thees question?” asked Andree, directly.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was something like this that Kendall had feared
from a meeting between Andree and Maude, that some
subject such as this would spring up, that he would be
subjected to embarrassment and discomfort. He was
embarrassed now because he fancied Maude would be
embarrassed and because he feared Andree, in her child-like
frankness, might say something which would shock
Maude’s American prudery. He did not make use of the
word <i>prudery</i>, but the state of mind for which it stood
was in his thoughts. He flushed and was about to attempt
some stammered diversion, but Maude answered, perfectly
calm and without hesitation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Captain Ware asked me if I would ever marry a man
who had had an affair with another girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah....” said Andree. Then: “And why not,
mademoiselle? What has that to do weeth the marriage?
It was a silly question, was it not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken regarded her anxiously, but she gave no sign that
she had attached any significance to his question other
than a faint note in the long-drawn “Ah....” with which
she had heard it stated.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, it was a ver’ silly question,” Andree repeated,
“for if it ees not then there shall nevair be any marriages
at all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know....” said Maude.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps it ees bicause mademoiselle ees ver’ yo’ng
and does not know the worl’,” said Andree, with an air
of age and wisdom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. It is something in myself. I resent the idea.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then there is but one hope for mademoiselle....
She mus’ marry the monk.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, listen here,” said Ken, bruskly. “This—this—Oh,
darn it all, let’s talk about something else.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree laughed gaily and pointed a finger of ridicule
at him. “Oh, see! We have frighten’ him.... He is
ver’ droll. Sometime’ he is same theeng as yo’ng girl
jus’ from the convent.... But he is ver’ good, mademoiselle,”
she said, suddenly and seriously. “He is mos’
good and gentle and kind, and I love him ver’ much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude touched Andree’s hand, and her eyes were not
guiltless of moisture. “I am sure you do, dear,” she said,
“and he must love you very dearly, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken felt that the situation demanded something of him;
that if he did not prove himself adequate to the demand
he would sink in his own estimation and take a lower
place in the regard of both the girls. It was awkward.
No situation could be more awkward, but a thing was
required of him if he desired to be true to himself and
worthy of the love that Andree had given him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“By God! I do!” he said, desperately, and had his reward
in the depths of the smile which came into Andree’s
eyes....</p>

<p class='c006'>There threatened to come an uncomfortable pause, but
Andree averted it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Monsieur Ken and I go soon for the <i>déjeuner</i>. Mademoiselle,
of course, comes also.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish I might,” said Maude, her voice a trifle dulled
and her eyes not altogether happy. “But I promised to
help out in the club on the Avenue Montaigne.... And
I must be going.” She looked at her wrist watch. “Indeed
I must. I can cross the street now.... Good-by,
Captain Ware. Good-by, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Au revoir</i>,” said Andree, holding out her hand. “We
mus’ meet again. There are many theengs we mus’ speak
of.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude looked down into Andree’s dark-shadowed black
eyes and smiled. “Yes,” she said, “we must speak of
many things....”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the morning Paris stopped in groups to whisper and
to point off to the northeastward. Paris was apprehensive.
It had been awakened before dawn by the
distant rumble of cannon, such a rumble as had never
before come to its ears, and it wanted to know the reason
for it. The guns had never sounded so loudly. Was it
that the <i>boches</i> had made a fresh advance and were by that
much nearer to the defenses of the city? Or had it been
some huge air raid turned abortive before it reached its
objective?... It was the 15th of July.</p>

<p class='c006'>Slowly, by devious channels, the news spread. The
enemy had struck again, had launched such a blow as
warfare had not seen up to this period.... And Paris
waited for the outcome. Then dull explosions were
heard in various parts of the city at regular intervals....
Big Bertha was at her work again; the long-range cannon
was once more bombarding Paris. As in the days past,
one might see wagons loaded high with trunks and
personal belongings moving toward a gate of the city or
toward a railway station as the more apprehensive
abandoned their homes for places of greater security.
These were days when it was impossible to find tenants
for the top floors of apartment-houses. There was a feeling
that one was safer from Bertha and the bomb with at
least one <i>étage</i> between him and the roof....</p>

<p class='c006'>Papers were eagerly snatched from kiosks and from
news-venders, who ran through the crowds with such
speed that it was almost impossible to buy their wares—but
the news was scanty. At least the guns were not
heard again. After that first tremendous artillery preparation
there was no sound from the direction of Château-Thierry
and Reims. The silence, the pall which the
censorship threw over events, was portentous, threatening.
People recalled the inexorability of the last two
German attacks. If this one proceeded as its predecessors
had done, Paris would be made untenable. There would
be a siege.... There was talk of complete evacuation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then tidings of a more encouraging nature filtered in.
The <i>boches</i> had advanced a little here and there, had been
checked at this and that point. There had been no
breaking through, no headlong rush upon Paris, no
marching down roads in columns of four with guns over
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 16th the apprehension was less, but the tension
was still present. The 17th saw Paris again almost at the
normal of war-times. It was reassured. It was rumored
that Foch had given his word that Paris was safe. The
magic of one man’s name was potent to reassure the
millions of citizens of the metropolis. If Foch said Paris
was safe, then Paris was safe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then came the 18th, which dawned as other days dawn,
with the same sun rising in the east, with the same blue
skies above, and the same breezes moving over the surface
of the same earth. But it was a day not like other
days. History may well set it down as the Day of Days,
for it marked the beginning of the end, the first note of the
finale of the crashing, discordant Germanic opera.... The
Allies had counterattacked, and fear was dead.
That was the significant thing. The 18th of July, A.D.,
1918, marked the death of fear in the heart of Paris.
From that date onward there would be no news but good
news. Terror of the Hun had become a thing which
one remembered but would no more experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Élysées Palace Hôtel knew by night that our First
and Second divisions had struck at the base of the German
salient about Reims and that our Twenty-sixth Division
had battered the apex before Château-Thierry—and at
last the American Expeditionary Force was in the war.
The Americans had come! The Americans were ready!
The Americans had started! Number 10 rue Ste.-Anne
knew these things, as did the American censorship high
up in the Bourse. It was a day of exultation for Americans
in Paris....</p>

<p class='c006'>In spite of censorships, in spite of military secrecy, in
spite of minute precautions, rumors circulate through
armies which have an undeniable basis of fact. On the
4th of July Kendall heard the soldiers of the First Division
stating confidently that they would march through
Paris streets on Bastille Day. No one had told them.
Nobody knew how the rumor earned its life, but it was
there, and the event proved its reliability. So an army
rumor receives a degree of belief which does not seem to be
warranted. Rumors were a plentiful harvest now; big
rumors and little rumors ... and among them, circulating
through the officers of the Intelligence Department
in Paris, was the whisper that some officer or officers
were to be sent back to America either on a mission or
to undertake permanent work.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken heard this prophecy early in the morning, and it
troubled him. He had no cause for imagining that he
would be selected, yet he might be selected. The chances
were, perhaps, minute, but, nevertheless, they were present,
and it was far from his desire to be returned to America
to run down German sympathizers in Hoboken or to
take a desk in some crowded bureau in Washington.
While he was in France there always was the hope that he
might be transferred to active duty with some regiment
at the front. Like all men in the American Expeditionary
Force, he wanted to serve at the front, and he did not
want to return to America—at least until the work was
done. Man after man Kendall had heard to speak longingly
of America, but to couple with his homesickness the
quick statement that he did not want to return until the
job was done. It was a sort of religion—the cleaning up
of that job. Somehow each man seemed to feel that the
success of the army depended on his presence, and that
to be sent home before victory arrived would be to
deprive him of something precious which he had earned.... It
was so with Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>But he had a stronger motive than most for wishing to
stay in France. It was Andree....</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly and very poignantly he realized what it would
mean if he were compelled to part from Andree. It
seemed to him that she had become a part of him, an
essential part without which he could not continue. She
had brought an essence into his life which was sweet
and desirable and wonderful. He knew that no other
woman could bring to him what Andree had brought so
unconsciously, yet so generously.... She was Andree!... Andree!
The world could show but one.</p>

<p class='c006'>What was to be the outcome? It was a question he
had evaded time and again, well knowing that it must
some day be faced. He did not face it now, though it
urged itself upon his attention. He did not believe the
world had seen a more precious thing than their love—and
yet, because of his training and the imprint of heredity,
that love was questionable, tainted with irregularity.
It was good, sweet, pure, but it was irregular as the Middle
West and Plymouth Rock perceived irregularity.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had never known Andree to utter an immodest
word or to think a thought that was not clean and good.
He had wondered at a certain diffident loftiness in her
thoughts. She was a woman whose soul was to be regarded
with awe, as any virtuous soul is to be regarded
with awe. He did not believe he saw her falsely, nor that
love blinded him to defects which should be apparent.
He knew he saw her truly, and that she was worthy of all
his love.... And yet his friends, his neighbors—above
all, his mother—would despise her as a woman of light
virtue, as a thing of evil.... He could see the seething
among the gossips if Andree were to be set down in their
midst, and he despised them.... But—</p>

<p class='c006'>Again he evaded. He had not the courage to ask
himself what he would do when the moment for doing
arrived.... He could not give her up. That was the
thought that came now—that she was indispensable.... But
would he have the courage to face the vestibule of the
Presbyterian church with her? He did not ask.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of those moods of depression to which he was
liable when his reflections were troubled settled upon him.
He was acutely unhappy. Those moods possessed a
physical sensation, not a pain so much as a consciousness
of the existence of his body, which was very disturbing.
It was as if his arms and legs had suddenly become vivid.
At such times he did not want companionship, could not
have answered conversational advances. The life within
him seemed to become as putty—a dead mass. The only
relief was to walk and walk and walk.</p>

<p class='c006'>He left the office to trudge to the apartment, meaning
to eat lightly and to wander about Paris until the obsession
was ejected.... At the entrance to the building the
concierge was standing, waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, monsieur ... monsieur,” she said, and broke
forth into weeping.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was not surprised. Such scenes were to be expected
in those days when every mail brought word that some
loved one had been demanded of his country. He patted
her shoulder awkwardly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have had evil news, madame,” he said. “I am so
sorry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Through her tears rage flared. “The <i>boches</i>,” she exclaimed.
“Why is it that the good God allows such
creatures to be!... What good can it do them? But
they would laugh and be joyous. It is so. I have read....
These killers of babies!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is it, madame? Your son? Have you had the
news?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My son, monsieur, is gone these two years,” she said,
not without a lift of the shoulders. “It would not be
that. When one is a soldier one must march....
To kill the men—that is war. But the babies—the helpless
little babies!... They are not men, monsieur, but
monsters....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.... Yes,” he answered, not knowing what to
say.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And monsieur loved her, did he not? It was Arlette
who declared it to be so. Always she spoke of the fondness
of monsieur for the <i>petite fille</i>—the tiny Arlette.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Little Arlette! What do you mean, madame? What
has happened to little Arlette?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>La longue portée, monsieur.</i> Again it began to fire this
day. It is that you have heard its explosions....
This Big Bertha of the boche that murders babies!...
<i>La pauvre enfant!</i> She is playing in the street before her
home. Out of the sky comes the shell of this so wicked
cannon. There is a noise of great frightfulness.” She
covered her eyes. “When the smoke makes to lift itself
and one can see—there lies little Arlette....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Killed!” Kendall felt something that was rage and
grief clutch his throat. “Have they killed that child?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She still lives, monsieur, and asks for you. It is so....
But she will die. It is dreadful. Yes.... Both
legs, monsieur, at the knee. They were swept from
beneath her as with a scythe ... and she still lives—asking
for monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She told him the hospital, and without a word he
turned, running, to search for a taxicab. The thing was
incredible. Little Arlette, that mite from fairyland,
maimed and bleeding and dying. Such things could not
be. This was not war.... He raged, though tears were
wet upon his cheeks.... As he rode, the dainty figure
of the child stood before him, chin upraised, mouth opened
birdwise to sing. He saw her as if she were real.... And
then he saw that scene in the street: children playing,
the sun daring to shine.... A sudden rushing in the air
above, a tremendous detonation. He saw it all, even
to the most minute happening. He saw little Arlette
standing erect, stricken with sudden fear, saw the burst
of the explosion, saw the child diminish suddenly in
stature as her little legs were flicked from under her and
she dropped upon bleeding stumps before toppling to the
pavement.... He uttered a hoarse groan of protest.... He
cowered back into a corner of the taxicab and
shut his eyes, as if that could shut out the pictures of
his imagination.</p>

<p class='c006'>And she had called for him!</p>

<p class='c006'>It seemed he was expected at the hospital, for he was
escorted immediately to the little bed upon which Arlette
lay. He had dreaded to see her, flinching from a sight
which he apprehended might be horrible. He forced
himself to look ... and the horror passed. The little
face upon the pillow was bloodless, her eyes closed. She
seemed not alive, but a thing of fragile loveliness carved
from some material brought into being by the fairies for
this very purpose.... There was no trace of pain—only
motionlessness, a mysterious gravity ... and
peace. Old Arlette sat with eyes fixed unwaveringly on
the little face; the child’s mother cowered with her face
against Arlette’s ample shoulder.... Ken stood in
silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The nurse touched his arm. “Speak to her,” she
whispered. “It will make no difference. She has asked
many times for you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is—alive?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And conscious.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will not—harm her to arouse her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing can harm her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall understood. Little Arlette was past hurt now,
and he had been brought there to give to the child her
last little moment of happiness.... He knelt by the cot.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne</i>,” he said, softly.</p>

<p class='c006'>She opened her eyes and stared at him, and then
smiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is come. Regard him. I said he would come.”
Her voice was so faint as to be almost no voice at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of a certainty I have come,” he said. “What could
keep me away from my little sweetheart?... Does—does
it hurt?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hurt?” She seemed vaguely surprised. “What
should hurt, monsieur?” She did not know what had
happened to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“May I kiss you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But yes. Is it not that I am to be your wife? I
wish you to kiss me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you love me very much, <i>mignonne</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, very much.... We shall be very happy,
monsieur, in this America of the North. I am too little
to be married now, is it not? But it will not be long....
My grandmother says I grow very fast.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have seen it myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She sighed. “I am glad. I had fear that you might
grow tired of waiting....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would wait for you forever, <i>mignonne</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Again she smiled. “I shall sing for monsieur. One
should stand up to sing ... but grandmother says I
must not stand up to-day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will it harm her?” Kendall asked, quickly, of the
nurse.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing will harm her,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then sing, dear ... sing ‘Madelon.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>The birdlike lips opened and the song came forth,
faint as a morning breeze, that song of the little barmaid
who stands to the <i>poilu</i> for the wife or sweetheart
at home, the little barmaid whom he kisses in his loneliness,
and in kissing her feels that he is touching the lips
of one far away.... It was a song which, to Middle-Western
ears, sounded strangely on the lips of a dying
child, but it did not offend Kendall.... It sprang from
the soul of France.</p>

<p class='c006'>There ceased to be any semblance of an air to the song;
it became a faint whisper, halting, coming now a word
at a time. Arlette’s eyes were closed.... Now her
lips moved, but there was no sound.... Presently the
lips ceased to move....</p>

<p class='c006'>Kendall turned to the nurse, who nodded. He arose
suddenly, looked down upon the child and then rushed
from the room ... and as he traversed the corridor he
found himself repeating again and again: “With a song
on her lips.... With a song on her lips....”</p>

<p class='c006'>For two months experiences had been jostling one
another to enter Kendall Ware’s life. It seemed as if there
was a conspiracy among events to modify him, to change
the fiber of him, and to break down the structure that had
been himself when he landed in France. As compared
with these past sixty days the previous ten thousand days
of his life had been colorless and without life.... It had
required twenty-seven years of personal existence and
more than one generation of predecessors to make him
what he was—and now a mere fraction of time, a handful
of minutes, were striving to undo all that had been
accomplished and to create a new being. The question
to be answered was: Can the present overcome the past?
Can events master the fiber growth of heredity? It
seemed an experiment to determine if individuality is a
fixed quantity or if it is subject to revolution.... So
far it might be asserted that Kendall had been modified—but
no more.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little Arlette had been a bit of humor in his life—no
more. He had been unconscious that she was anything
more. But now in her catastrophe she loomed larger and
assumed significance. His was a world of symbolisms, a
religion of symbolisms. As his mother saw the hand of
God in every event—the hand of God interposed with
direct reference to herself—so Kendall, in a minor degree,
and perhaps with something of unconsciousness, was subject
to the same obsession. He looked for the lessons of
events. He was apprehensive of the warnings of events.
An implacable God regarded him under lowering brows
and now and then caused an event to occur for his guidance....
So he looked for the significance of Arlette’s
murder.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had an uncomfortable feeling that innocence had
been caused to perish for his benefit—as a lesson to him.
It made him a sort of accessory after the fact. He
rebelled in a vague way, feeling dimly that God had no
right to implicate him in such a crime. Old catch phrases
came back to him as he walked toward his home, phrases
such as that one must search for the divine purpose behind
the event; that the ways of God pass human understanding;
that it is all for the best!... There was no
comfort in these. He could descry no divine purpose.
For that matter, he could find no divine purpose back of
the war.... Yet God permitted it, furthered it, as it
were.... And because it was, because Divinity permitted
it to occur, it followed indisputably that it must be right
for it to occur.... He would not have dared to define
his creed as stating that his God was one who committed
wholesale crime that a remote benefit might accrue. Yet
that was his creed and the creed of hundreds of thousands
of his fellow-countrymen.... It was strange that he
should remember Andree’s attitude toward God at that
moment—her saying that the eyes of the good God must
be wet with tears to see a wickedness. But he did remember,
and was grateful to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>He wandered in a maze of gloomy theorizings, a maze
which was nothing but a maze, which led to no desired
center. It was the struggle between present and past,
and it was a drawn battle. It only left him bewildered
and gloomy, treading a bog and miring at every step....
Then he became aware that he wanted Andree,
that she was necessary to him, because there was something
simple and sure about her. She gave him a handhold
to cling to. He felt that she knew, and he wanted
the security and uplift of her knowledge. The universe
was toppling, and Andree could stabilize it again—but
Andree was not coming.... He felt he would never
need her more than at this moment, but she was residing
in her land of mystery, and he had neither her name nor
address....</p>

<p class='c006'>The stark fact was that little Arlette was dead—and
with a song on her tiny lips. He would never again think
of France without thinking of Arlette ... without seeing
Arlette as a symbol of something at once pure and
ruthless....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Now began a phase of Kendall Ware’s life which was to
continue for a matter of six weeks, a period full
of conflict between anomalies, of indecisions, of procrastinations.
There stood out high moments of happiness,
and there were dark descents into unlighted realms
of self-distrust. He questioned everything, doubted
everything, and most especially did he doubt his own
ability to weigh events and to choose between the better
and the worse. He almost doubted if he had the power
of choice and felt a dour leaning toward predestination.
Much of this was self-deception, and conscious self-deception.
He was becoming increasingly aware of a
day when he would have to make a choice and reach a
decision, but he was afraid of that day. He knew the
choice was his, and could belong to no other individual
or force. <i>He</i> must choose. The event was in his keeping.</p>

<p class='c006'>Three major questions presented themselves: First,
what was he going to do about Andree? Second, what
was he going to do about Maude Knox? And, third,
which was interwoven with the first, what about the
vestibule of the Presbyterian church?</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken had not the least doubt that he loved Andree.
That was the one sure fact in the whole confused mass.
He loved Andree and Andree loved him. To many
young men, perhaps to most, this alone would have
answered all his questions. Perhaps the ordinary young
man would have thought of nothing else, but, perceiving
that Andree was essential to him, he would have taken her
and made her his own in permanence with due forms of
marriage. This would have been the natural step for
youth to take—disregarding consequences and challenging
the future. But Ken was not an ordinary young man.
He was a young man who was afraid of the future, who
had been brought up to know a lively fear of the opinion
of the community among which he lived. “What will
folks say?” was a question he had heard propounded from
his earliest childhood, until the thing that “they” would
say had assumed a place of importance in his affairs
second to nothing. It had almost confused his perceptions
of right and wrong, for, even as a small boy, it had
been made to appear to him that his mother was not so
much concerned with the righteousness of any given act
as she was by the effect of that act upon her circle of
neighbors. Undoubtedly this was a mistaken notion, but
it had at least the color of truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>He recalled vividly how a certain prominent member
of his church had become an absconder and the coming
of the news of it into his household. He remembered how
his father had said: “Mother, we don’t know all the ins
and outs of it. Maybe he’s more sinned against than
sinning. We don’t know....” His mother had rejected
that view harshly. “Whatever will people say
about him? It’ll be terrible on his wife, and him so
prominent in the church.” She had not said, “What will
God say about him?” but, “What will people say?” His
sin, so it had seemed to Ken’s young mind, had not been
so much in absconding with money as it had been in
creating adverse talk.... This attitude of mind had
altered somewhat with years, but never had his fear of
clacking tongues diminished. It stood for the supreme
punishment of evil ... not hell, but gossip.</p>

<p class='c006'>So his first and third questions stood together, and he
dared not force himself to answer them. The second
question could not be answered until he had satisfied the
other two.... There came a fourth question, upon
which, ultimately, must hang the answers to all, and
that was, “Can a man marry a woman with whom he has
had such a relation as I have had with Andree?” In
other words, could he, by his own act, unfit Andree to
become his own wife? This question did not present
itself poignantly for some time, but it was beginning to
formulate in the back of his mind. As yet he was considering
only the expediency of matters; later he would
find trouble with their moral and sociological aspects.</p>

<p class='c006'>Matters further complicated themselves when Maude
Knox informed him that she had been assigned permanently
to an administrative position in Paris. He
would be compelled to see her frequently. He would
want to see her frequently. Somehow this seemed unfair
to Andree, but he knew that Maude could not remain in
the city without his seeing a great deal of her. Andree
would discover this, and what would Andree do about it?
With Maude Knox absent her importance receded, was
held in abeyance; if she were here she would grow increasingly
important—and what would come of it?</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t seem overjoyed,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m glad you’re going to be here,” he said, “but just
the same, I wish you weren’t.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why? You aren’t compelled to have anything to do
with me if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s it. I am compelled, and I don’t know whether
I want to or not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well!...” She drew the word out to its full value.
“I must say you’re frank.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Please don’t be offended. I don’t mean to be offensive,
but things have gotten so rottenly complicated with
me that I’m afraid of another complication.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I’m a complication?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He nodded. “You know it,” he said. “I think you
know more about what a complication you are than I do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are thinking Andree will be jealous.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m thinking she may have cause to be jealous.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you don’t want her to have?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s just it. I don’t know.... I don’t want
anything ever to happen to make her unhappy. You and
I have talked pretty frankly, haven’t we? Somehow you
seem to understand things over here, though you are as
American as I am—and you—well, you don’t make a fuss.
But even at that, you don’t know how I feel about her....
Maybe I’m going to be in love with you, and maybe
I’m in love with you already. I don’t know.... But
I do know that I love her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you are by way of making love to me you’ve invented
a new method.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m not making love to you. I guess I’m trying to
reason things out aloud.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Using me as a wall to bounce your ball against.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He smiled without mirth. “Something like that. I
know I love Andree, but yet I can see myself in love
with you.... I’ve asked you before if a man can be in
love with two girls at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know. Not in the same way, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It would be different. If I did love you I would be
thinking about marriage all the time. It would mean
marriage. I would want you for my wife.... But
Andree—she doesn’t mean that. At least marriage
doesn’t figure in it. I can’t explain exactly, but it’s as if
there never had been such a thing in the world as marriage—only
love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m not sure but that is better. Even if I am American
I don’t know but I’d rather have that kind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Andree isn’t just an adventure, an incident. She’s
more important than that—the most important thing that
ever happened to me.... I can’t explain. I can feel
it, but I can’t express what it is. It isn’t that I couldn’t
marry her, nor that I wouldn’t be mighty lucky to have
her for a wife.... It seems, somehow, that marriage
doesn’t signify—isn’t necessary.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re trying to get at.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t, either. I’m trying to find out.... But I
do know that I don’t want to hurt her or make her sorry
she has loved me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How about me?” she asked, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How about hurting me?” she asked. “You’ve made
a weird sort of love to me. You’ve balanced on the fence
and told me you might fall in love with me. You’ve
carried on a sort of rubber-elastic courtship—ready to
snap back out of reach if I seemed likely to catch you....
Have you thought about me at all? Really, I’ve
some right to be considered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was right. Undoubtedly he had not been fair to
her. He had thought only of himself and of his sentiments
toward her, but scarcely at all of her sentiments
toward him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why,” he said, “I don’t believe I’ve thought of that
side of it. It never occurred to me that you—that you
might be in love with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I’m not.” She spoke sharply.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you mean you never could be?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There! Of all things!... You want me to tell you
that if you make up your mind to condescend to love
me I’ll be ready to drop into your hands. You want to
have your cake and eat it. I’d say you were the most
completely selfish person I’ve ever encountered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Really I’m not. It isn’t selfishness.... It’s just
that I am so confused by the whole situation that I don’t
know what to do.... You don’t know how relieved and
happy I would be if there was nobody but you, and we
were going to be married. You are just the kind of wife—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That your neighbors would approve of,” she interrupted.
“I know. What I don’t know is why I
keep on talking to you like this. I ought to send you
about your business and tell you never to come near me
again ... but I’m not going to. You’ve told me in
effect that you would be in love with me if it weren’t
for somebody else, and that the only reason you are
pleased to consider me as a candidate at all is because
you are afraid your family and your neighbors would
make a fuss if you took the other woman home. That’s
the truth, and you know it is.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” he said, ruefully, and not wisely, “so long as
you don’t love me, what does it matter?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So long as I don’t love you it doesn’t matter in the
least.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But—”</p>

<p class='c006'>She shook her head. “We sha’n’t talk about my
loving you. I’m not going to love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you mean that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Decidedly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You wouldn’t marry me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Really, I think you’re out of your mind. Even if I
loved you—which I don’t—do you think I’d sit and wait
for you to reason out that you had better fall in love
with me, and then grab you with wild eagerness—after
you make up your mind to chuck another woman whom
you have assured me that you do love?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But suppose I do love you? Would the fact of my—my
affair with Andree prevent you from marrying me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you loved me and I loved you nothing in the world
would stop me from marrying you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anyhow, I’ve got that question answered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And much good may it do you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because the condition doesn’t exist. If it did exist
I might answer differently. I might think then that I
could never marry a man who had done such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This conversation took place at noon in a little café
on the rue St.-Honoré not distant from the Y. M. C. A.
headquarters. Kendall had met Maude Knox as he was
seeking a place to lunch, and they had gone together.
Now he wished he might sit and argue the question until
his status with her was definitely settled, if it could be
definitely settled, but she refused to pursue the subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, that’s all we talk about that. You can pick
out any subject you want to, but we are through talking
about you and me.... And, besides, I’ve got to get
back to work.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When shall we have dinner together?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re angry with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, but I’m disgusted with myself because I’m not.
If I had a spark of pride I’d never speak to you again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ken Ware, you are a miracle of denseness. Don’t you
know that this whole conversation has been impossible—that
it couldn’t have happened? I never imagined such
cool effrontery! But I’m not offended, and I don’t know
why.... I’ll dine with you some evening soon—but
not to touch this subject again. Don’t ever mention it—never!
I’ve got some rights to be thought about, and
I’m going to think about them. There are just two
things you may do: either propose to me out and out, so
I can refuse you, or else treat me as a friend, and no
trimmings. I mean it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I don’t want to do either.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’ll have to.” She laughed, and slid deftly from
behind the table. “Are you going to walk up the street
with me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me pay the check.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He called a waiter and asked for <i>l’addition</i> and then
walked to the corner of the rue d’Aguesseau with Maude.
She did not permit him to linger.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-by,” she said, turning abruptly away. “Drop
me a note when you feel in a condescending mood.”</p>

<p class='c006'>That evening when he got home he found Bert and
Madeleine there ahead of him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Andree’s coming, too,” said Bert. “I met her this
afternoon and told her there was going to be a party....
This is a farewell. See Madeleine’s tears?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Farewell?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. I’m going away for a couple of weeks—some
buildings to look after. I don’t mind, but Madeleine’s
darn near heartbroken.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh yes,” said Madeleine, gaily. “My heart it break.
I am so lonely.... You see, Monsieur Bert he is the
on’y American <i>officier</i> in France. When he is gone, there
is no other.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t mean that,” said Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course she does,” Bert said, with a grin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken shrugged his shoulders and went to his room to
tidy up a bit for dinner. He heard them laugh, and
Bert’s voice said, “He thinks we are very naughty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He did think so, but in spite of himself he liked Madeleine,
indeed, felt a real friendship for her. She was not
like Andree, but she possessed qualities which could not
pass unnoticed. She was generous, kind, always concerned
for Bert’s comfort and financial welfare. There
was not a mercenary hair in her head, if there was not a
serious hair. Even though there was nothing deep and
enduring and lofty in her relations with Bert, there was
nothing sordid. She was seeking her little moments of
happiness, seeking them lightly, gaily, carelessly....
Ken excused his own conduct because it was concerned
with a great love and a beautiful fidelity. There were no
such matters between Bert and Madeleine, yet Ken could
not find it in his heart to denounce her as bad. According
to all his standards she was bad—a light creature.
But, somehow, he did not see her as a light woman
nor as wicked.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would have been difficult to find any one more
different from Andree.... Ken had become used to
accepting Andree’s judgments in large measure, and
Andree did not declare Madeleine <i>méchante</i>. She, too,
liked the girl, accepted her as a friend and equal.... It
was all a part of this strange world with its upsetting
standards....</p>

<p class='c006'>The bell interrupted his moral reflections and he hurried
to the door with that thrill of anticipation which
Andree’s arrival always caused.... There she stood,
very straight and still and grave, just as he knew she
would be. She raised her eyes to his exactly as he knew
she would raise them, and smiled appealingly. He drew
her inside, into his arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve been needing you, <i>mignonne</i>,” he said. “Everything
goes wrong when you’re not with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am here,” she said, brightly. “Behol’! all is now
well. I shall let nothing trouble you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you love me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.... And you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are very beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is well.... No, I am not beautiful, but it is
well you theenk it is so. I am happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She regarded him solicitously. “You are ver’ tired.
Have you work’ <i>beaucoup</i>? It is not that you have an
illness?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.... No. Everything is all right now that you
are here. You are the only person who is <i>right</i> in the
whole world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!... Oh!... I am ver’ wonderful! I do not
know thees till I meet you. I theenk I am only a yo’ng
girl, but behol’! I have ver’ suddenly become—how do
you say?—The <i>dictionnaire</i>—queek. The <i>dictionnaire</i>!”
Laughing gaily, she searched with ludicrous haste for the
word and could not find it. “Oh, it is terrible! W’at I
am I cannot say. I am something that ees not in the
<i>dictionnaire</i>. To be a thing that is not in the <i>dictionnaire</i>
is mos’ grand and étonnant—astonishing. I shall to be
ver’ vain.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her eyes were dancing with an impish light. She
seemed very young, a child, endowed with some magical
quality which reassured him, dispelled the heaviness
which rested on him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have Monsieur Bert and Mademoiselle Madeleine yet
arrive’?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They’re in the <i>salon</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come. We shall see them—now.” Again that
quaint gesture of poking downward at the floor with a
slender finger. “Thees minute.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The girls shook hands formally and lapsed into an
amazing splutter of French. Ken looked from one to the
other, from Andree, tiny, fragile, dark, elfin, to Madeleine,
tall, slender, fair of hair, always laughing. Madeleine
seemed nothing but embodied laughter; Andree seemed
to him now as she always seemed to him, a mystery,
incomprehensible—a being come to him out of a land
of wonders.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert is going away,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For how long?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Three weeks.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, it ees a lifetime. Mademoiselle will be ver’ sad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She says not,” Ken said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not possible. She will be mos’ sad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not Madeleine,” said Bert. “She’s going to find
another American officer to keep her happy while I’m
gone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But she could not—<i>non, non!</i> You do not theenk!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Madeleine laughed gaily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What would you do if I went away for three weeks?”
Ken asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do not go!... It ees not true.” Her eyes grew
big and her lips parted as she waited for his answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I’m not going any place.... But if I should go,
what would you do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should be ver’ <i>solitaire</i>. Ver’ often I should weep.
And I should work ver’ hard at all times—to make the
days go more fast.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you find another American officer to help you
pass the time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know,” she said, simply.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Oh, là là!</i>” exclaimed Madeleine. “Regard these
children. It ees the great love. <i>Toujours fidèle.</i> It ees
mos’ beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is ever’thing,” said Andree. “You, mademoiselle,
love a ver’ little. So you are happy a ver’ little. <i>N’est-ce
pas?</i> I love ver’ much, so I am happy ver’ much. It is
clear. You theenk you are mos’ happy, but you do not
know. It is not until you love, mademoiselle, until you
love weeth all the love there is that you have the great
happiness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It may be so.... But also the great sadness. Is it
not so? Regard me. I love thees Monsieur Bert a
leetle. He makes to go away, so I am sad a leetle. Yes?
But, then, I love him so ver’, ver’ much and he makes to
go away. And then?...” She shrugged her shoulders.
“Behol’—then I am in despair. I theenk my way is
more better. Not the great joy, but also not the great
sadness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Non!... Non!...</i> It ees not so. There is the
great sadness, it is true. <i>Certainement!</i> But even that,
mademoiselle, is sweet. Bicause one remembers the
great love and the great joy. The so great happiness has
been. It will nevair die. No. For so long as one lives
the happiness will remain.... The grief—one must
expect grief.... It is a part of the worl’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Vous êtes un poète, mademoiselle....</i> You write the
poetry. Therefore you are different. The poet makes of
sadness a great thing, a wonderful thing.... But I—I,
mademoiselle, am cashier in a shop. I do not have the so
beautiful thoughts. No, I am jus’ a girl that loves to be
happy always. I cannot think the wonderful thoughts
like the poet—<i>non</i>. To me it seems that ver’ many
leetle happinesses without a sorrow are more better than
one great, wonderful happiness of the poet—but also
with the terrible grief that makes to kill.... So I love
a little and laugh all the days and am ver’ content.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you not wish to love—to have forever one
man and to love him weeth the great love?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, that is another matter. Always to have one
lover, one husband! It is different. Then I would love—yes.
I would love as much as any one.... But it is
not possible. Do I not know? Where do I get the
husband? <i>Pouf!</i> There is no husband for me, and as
for lovers—thees American lovers—they come, and it is a
little while when they go. So I do not love. I make
believe to love, and so I am happy.... But why,
mademoiselle, give to one of them the great love when
one knows well it is but for a day? It is to throw away
the love, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree was silent; all were silent. Madeleine had thrust
the situation before Kendall and Andree baldly. Ken
drew Andree to him, but she did not respond; she was
cold, frightened.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But for a day ...” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Monsieur Bert and I we do not deceive ourselves.
We tell each other that thees is not for always.... It
is play—so there is no cloud between us.... But you—oh,
you are ver’ wrong, mademoiselle. In your heart you
know.... You love Monsieur Ken and he loves you—it
is true. But—ask him the question, mademoiselle—does
he stay forever? Or, when the day comes on which
he mus’ depart, will he take you weeth him to thees
America?... Ask him, mademoiselle, and if he tell you
you shall be weeth him always, then I am wrong.” She
looked at Ken. He was conscious that Andree was looking
at him appealingly, and that even Bert was demanding
something of him with his eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>He might have lied. He might have assured Andree
that she should never leave him, but with her eyes upon
him he could not lie.... He did not know. This was
the thing that was making him miserable—the question of
whether he should take Andree to America with him....
He did not know. Therefore he answered, lamely:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I love you, <i>mignonne</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It ees not an answer,” said Madeleine, inexorably.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t answer.... I can’t see the future.... I
don’t know. All I know, Andree, is that I do love you.
Why can’t we be satisfied with that until we have to
decide?... The war will be long. I shall be here for
years, perhaps.... Oh, my dear, I cannot think of a
life without you—but I do not know....”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was conscious that he was proving inadequate to the
situation, that he was not measuring up to what Andree
had a right to expect of him, and he was afraid of what
she might do or say. Madeleine shrugged her shoulders
expressively. He looked at Andree apprehensively, saw
her eyes flash with anger, her little figure grow tense,
her lips compress. It was the first time he had ever seen
her angry.... He had offended her. She was in a
rage with him, and rightly in a rage.... She stepped
close to him and clasped his arm with both hands, turning
her face toward Madeleine and Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See!” she exclaimed, and her black eyes flashed,
“you have make him unhappy weeth your questions....
I shall not have questions asked of him.... <i>Non!</i>
He shall not be troubled. It is not the affair of any one
but himself and me.... I will not permit it....
What is it to you? It is for us alone. If it is <i>nécessaire</i>
that he leave me one day—that is for him to say. Is it
that I have ask or demand anything? <i>Non, non, non!...</i>
He is ver’ good, and I love him—jus’ like he love’
me.... I know that and I am satisfy.... You shall
not make him to be unhappy weeth questions....”</p>

<p class='c006'>She faced them, tense, breathing rapidly. Her hands
clutched his arm and pressed it to her breast....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Andree ...” he said, hoarsely. “Andree ...”</p>

<p class='c006'>She smiled up at him, her face softening, her eyes
becoming big and tender. “Ever’thing is well,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert drew a long breath. “By Jupiter!” he said, and
there was admiration in his eyes. “I’ll tell you what,
Andree, if you’ll have me, if you can put up with a roughneck
like me, I’ll take you for keeps ... and to hell
with the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Madeleine laughed and shook her head. “You see how
<i>fidèle</i> thees Monsieur Bert is.... <i>Là là!</i> But you shall
not have heem, mademoiselle, until I am through weeth
him.... See, there is the head of Arlette.... Let us
have the dinner and be gay!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>There are persons who seem to have their emotions
under the control of push-buttons, as it were. They
are capable of friendship and anger and love and jealousy,
but they have been given the faculty of suppressing these
emotions until it is their desire to allow them freedom.
Maude Knox was one of these. It would be unfair to
say that she was coldly calculating, but she was careful.
Many of the minor inhibitions which rule American girls
did not signify to her; she was broader of mind, capable
of perceptions of which her sisters were incapable. But
she did not fly into passions, nor was she given to headlong
tumbles into love.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her condition with respect to Kendall Ware was noncommittal.
As a matter of fact, she was not in love with
him, because he had not committed himself. If Ken had
come frankly to her, declaring his love, and had asked
her to be his wife she would by this time have been as
much in love with him as he could have desired. Nobody
could deny that they were suited to each other, and
nature has seen to it that young people who are suited
to each other, and enjoy propinquity with each other, do
fall in love. It seems to be the law that everybody must
love somebody; it also seems to be the law that propinquity
is nine-tenths of the matter.... So Maude was
in a receptive mood. She was ready to let go and be
very much in love with Ken when a suitable moment
arrived—if it ever did arrive.</p>

<p class='c006'>Once she had released her controls she would be tender,
faithful, a wife such as any man might boast of. His life
would be her life. His concerns would be her concerns.
Her career would be to make him happy and to make a
success of the family of which he would be the head.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just how much she realized of this condition it would be
difficult to say. Just how much she desired Kendall to
fall in love with her she herself did not know; but she did
like him, liked him a great deal. He was on her mind, and
perhaps she even schemed a little to have him near her
frequently and so to give him the opportunity to love
her if such a thing were to happen. But at the same time
she held a serious doubt if she would marry him in any
event—because of Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>True, she was of broad mind, and her life abroad had
enabled her to perceive and to understand many matters
which are obscure in America. These she could understand
and condone or pronounce to be good and even
virtuous—when they did not touch her directly. They
were all right for others, but—but when they entered her
own life that made of it another matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>If she had been told that in a time past Kendall Ware
had carried on an affair with a French girl—an affair that
was wholly of the past—she might have dismissed it after
small bitterness and have accepted him without more
than a slight question. But this was present, going on
under her eyes. She saw the workings of it, and saw that
he actually loved this girl. That it was the sort of love
he would one day give to his wife she did not believe.
That did not seem possible to her.... On the other
hand, there were many periods when she knew a fear
that Kendall would marry Andree. She asked herself
why he should not marry Andree. She had seen the
girl, talked with her, found her beautiful and sweet—even
good. Maude even felt a sympathy for Andree to
the extent of warning Kendall against tampering with the
girl’s happiness. Her sympathies were with Andree
rather than with Kendall. She had never experienced
the slightest aversion for Andree, none of that aversion
which a woman safe in the possession of what she terms
her virtue is entitled by ruthless custom to feel for the
girl who is no longer a maid. She was able to conceive
of a union such as Andree’s with Ken as possessing a sort
of regularity, as being made more or less regular by the
standards and conceptions of the society in which they
were living.... But, nevertheless, when it came to
marrying Ken her American prejudices and conceptions
took on life and set themselves up as a barrier.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was natural that she should be very curious about
Andree and should wish the opportunity of meeting and
studying the girl. She was rather frank and outspoken
herself and could imagine herself discussing the situation
with this girl and, perhaps, arriving at some determination.
But the opportunity failed to present itself for days
and weeks. Her brief chat with Andree on Bastille Day
had proved nothing, and it was not until early August
when a chance meeting in the Galeries Lafayette, where
both girls happened to be shopping, gave her the opportunity
she desired.</p>

<p class='c006'>They met on one of the broad winding stairways of that
enormous store, Andree descending, Maude ascending.
Of the two Andree was the more self-possessed. She
looked at Maude with that quaintly inquiring expression
with which she seemed to greet all the world, but gave
no other sign of recognition until Maude smiled and
extended her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Bon jour, mademoiselle</i>,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Bon jour</i>,” responded Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve been hoping to see you for a long time. We
hardly got acquainted in that little chat we had a month
ago.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are sure you wish to be acquainted?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, very.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why? That’s difficult to put into words, isn’t it?
But I know about you—and you must know about me.
We just ought to be acquainted better.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eet is possible. You will know me. Ver’ well. I
also would know you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Suppose we have <i>déjeuner</i> together, then. Have you
finished your shopping?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ever’thing—all is completed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude turned and walked down the stairs with Andree.
They did not speak until they had traversed the crowded
aisles and reached the street. Each was thinking about
the other, but with this difference: Maude was wondering
what Andree thought about her, while Andree was not
concerned in the least with Maude’s opinion of herself.
She thought of Maude only as some one in whom Ken
was more interested than she liked, and wondered what
this American girl would say to her.... Maude was
impressed, not exactly in spite of herself, with Andree’s
appearance and manner. The girl was so slender, so
dainty, so appealing, so childlike and fragile! One could
not help wanting to defend her and befriend her....
But it was not befriending her to wish to take away the
man she loved and who loved her, which was the thing
that could not but rest in the back of Maude’s mind.
She had a feeling that Andree knew that desire was in
her mind....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let us go to the Petrograd—it is only a few steps. I
am living there now. A great many of us American girls
live there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ver’ well,” said Andree, who, it seemed, had placed
herself on the knees of the gods and was prepared to let
events wait upon her at their will.</p>

<p class='c006'>They made their way to the rue Caumartin and turned
to the right. Presently they entered the courtyard of the
Hôtel Petrograd and made their way to a dining-room
well filled with American girls in the uniforms of the
various war-service organizations. Selecting a table in a
sheltered corner, they ordered luncheon, nor did they
speak except of casual matters until they had finished.
Andree addressed herself to her plate with that quaint
absorption which always delighted Kendall. It touched
Maude now, as everything about this appealing little girl
touched her. She found herself actually growing fond
of Andree as one might grow fond of a lovable child....
And yet she had a certainty that she would not find
Andree altogether childlike; that in all matters appertaining
to her love she would be all woman and amply
potent to defend herself and her rights.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now we shall speak,” said Andree, looking into
Maude’s face with directness, almost with challenge.
Her own face, if it showed any expression at all, spoke of
hesitation, diffidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What shall we talk of?” Maude asked, experimentally.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is for you to say, mademoiselle. It is you who
make the suggestion that we speak together....” Then,
with disconcerting directness, “You wish to speak about
Monsieur Ware, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said Maude, “I should like to talk about him—and
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is ver’ well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that it reached the point of discussing Kendall,
Maude was nonplussed for a moment. How should she
open the discussion, if discussion there were to be? What
could she say that would not be an impertinence to this
girl, whom, somehow, she did not want to offend? Maude
even respected her, perceived that about Andree which
demanded respect and consideration. She hesitated.
Andree smiled and leaned a bit forward.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mademoiselle,” she said, “perhaps it is that you are
in love with thees yo’ng man also. Is it of that you wish
to speak?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am not in love with him, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah ... but that is not the ver’ truth—no. I have
seen. I do not know—maybe you theenk you do not
love him, but you do love him. That is why I am willing
to speak weeth you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am willing to speak weeth you about Monsieur
Ware bicause I love him ver’ much and bicause you
also love him. I theenk it mus’ be bicause I know
we both wish ver’ much to have him always be happy.
Is it not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I do not love him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, mademoiselle, it is not of a necessity for us
to speak at all. If you are merely his frien’, his acquaintance,
you have no right to speak weeth me about
him. It is so. <i>Mais</i>, if you love him”—she lifted her
shoulders—“that is ver’ different.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He has not asked me to love him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is well. I theenk he loves me very <i>fidèle</i>. Yes.
But also he theenk of you ver’ much. I have seen.
You are of his country and are ver’ pretty. He theenk
of you and compare you weeth me. I am French....
That is not American. He theenk about w’en he goes
back to America, and then bicause I am ver’ French and
not American he is troubled. He theenk I do not onderstan’,
but I onderstan’ ver’ well. He say that he love
Andree in Paris, and in Paris Andree is ver’ nice, but in
America, where all is so different, then he does not know
what to theenk.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And then he theenk of you, mademoiselle, of you who
would not be foreign and strange and at whom his friends
would not make to shrug their shoulder’ and lift the eyebrow’—bicause
I do not know the manner and the
custom.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that all that troubles you—not knowing the manners
and the customs?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What else could there be, mademoiselle? I am not
<i>très-jolie</i>—ver’ beautiful—but also I am not so hideous.
I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude shifted the subject because she was not ready
to speak about the thing which would be troublesome
more than manners and customs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Has he asked you to go to America with him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, mademoiselle. We have not speak of that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you would go? You would leave your France
and your people and go to a strange land?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I theenk, mademoiselle, that I would leave the worl’
for Monsieur Ware.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As his wife?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As to that, I do not care. If he wish, then ver’
well. If he do not wish, then ver’ well, also. The
marriage—makes nothing to us. It is only the love....
But you, mademoiselle, you make of marriage the
necessity.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would not marry him—I do not think I would
marry him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You would love him—as I do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.... No.... You misunderstand. Even if I
loved him I do not think I would marry him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And why? It is ver’ strange. Perhaps it is some
American custom.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course I am American.... But the reason is
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Myself!... Oh, I do not onderstan’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not believe I could bring myself to marry him
when he has loved you—as he has. When he has—been
your lover.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree’s eyes were wide with surprise. “It is ver’
strange,” she said. “What have I to make weeth it?
Suppose one day he do not love me any more, but loves
you ver’ much. Then you will not marry him bicause of
me? Oh, that ees ver’—how do you say?—ver’ silly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is hard to explain. Something inside me rebels
against it. I would always think about it.... It would
seem to me that he was tainted ... not clean as a husband
should be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mademoiselle!</i>” Andree sat very erect, her lips compressed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t misunderstand me.... Please! I do not
mean to offend. I expressed myself clumsily—and yet
that was what I meant. It is nothing against you....
I have seen you, and I believe I can almost understand
you. You are sweet and good—but you are
different....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Much different, mademoiselle, for that if I love then
nothing matters. I give, and I do not ask questions. I
theenk not of myself, but of him. It is the truth. I
say, can I make him ver’ happy.... But I do not ask
if I am so ver’ good that he is not so good as I am?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish I could explain. I can never understand you
wholly, and you—I’m afraid you will never be able to
understand me at all. We have grown up in different
worlds. You here, I in America.... Do you know
that what you are doing is very bad in America? that a
girl who does as you have done is an outcast? that no one
will receive her in their homes nor have anything to do
with her? ... People would say you were bad....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, thees America! It is ver’ <i>sérieux</i>. Is there not
love in America, then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Love is proper only when people marry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And in America I would be a bad girl?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bicause I love ver’ much and am <i>fidèle</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because you love without marriage.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And that makes Monsieur Ware bad also—bicause he
love’ me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It makes him—yes, people would say he was bad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is a lie. He is not bad, but ver’ good and kind.
Do I make him bad? Oh, mademoiselle, that is a ver’
silly thing. I would only make him good and happy.
It is the ver’ truth.... And bicause of me he is made
bad and you must not marry him!... Regard me,
mademoiselle, what harm do you theenk he has from
me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No harm from you. Oh, I mean it.... I—I don’t
blame him. If I were a man I think—yes, I’m sure—I
should love you as he does.... But—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But he is bad, and I have made him bad?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It isn’t you who make him bad....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then he is not bad, for there is no other. I am ver’
sure. He is <i>fidèle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t understand. It is not <i>you</i> who make him
bad, but the thing he is doing ... his relations with you.
They are bad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is mos’ difficult—like some philosophy in a big
book. I make him bad, but I do not make him bad, yet
he is bad bicause of me....” Her eyes began to flash
as she arose in Kendall’s defense. “It is not true. What
you say is ver’ bad and wicked. For he is nevair bad....
As for me, I do not theenk I am bad. No. I do not
theenk <i>le bon Dieu</i> believes I am bad. You yourself,
mademoiselle, have seen me and speak weeth me. Do
you theenk I am bad?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, dear. I believe you are good.... I mean
it. From the bottom of my heart, I believe you are
good.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is well. Then, can one take something bad from
one who is good? See! To be bad is to offend the good
God. Have I offended the good God who smiles when
there is a great love? I do not theenk. Have I made
Monsieur Ken to offend the good God?... I should
not be happy as I am if it were so.... Have I made
him to do a wickedness? Am I a woman of that sort?
It is not true. All I have desire is for him to be good
and to be ver’ happy.... That is not a sin, and it does
not make a sin for him.... And you would not marry
him even though you love him.... Mademoiselle, that
is not a good love, not such a love as make the good God
to smile.... It is a wickedness to love so....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dear—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.... Let me speak. Suppose thees Monsieur
Ware have love me and marry me—and I am no more.
I am dead. Then you would not marry him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is different altogether. There would be no
reason why I shouldn’t marry him then.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I tell you, it is the same. Behol’! he loves me
so ver’ much, and one day he does not love me bicause
the war is done and he mus’ go home, and it is not possible
for him to carry me weeth him.... The theeng is ended.
It is as if I were dead—as I should desire it to be. The
love was the same as if I have marry him.... He would
then nevair be weeth me any more. I would be as if I
were not.... And he would have taken no harm....
To say that he would be harmed is to say that to love a
man more than any other theeng in the worl’ is to harm
him, and to say that, mademoiselle, is <i>impie—blasphématoire</i>—to
say a theeng which is an insult to God....
No!... No!... You make a wrong.... Because
he have love’ then he is better—not more wicked....
I say to you, mademoiselle, that the love like I
have for Monsieur Ware makes to keep him from a sin.
I know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maude’s eyes were not dry. She was listening to a
thing that rang with truth and with goodness. She saw
what she had never been able to perceive before, and it
showed her that Kendall Ware could take no harm from
Andree, let their relations be what they might, for Andree
was good, with a simplicity and a faith and a purity
greater and better than any she had ever known. American
as she was, reared upon the traditions of Plymouth
Rock, which are as unbending as the laws of the Medes
and Persians, she perceived the truth, saw that to judge
is a power withheld from mortals and jealously guarded
by God....</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dear!... My dear!...” she said, tremulously.
“I—Can you forgive me?... You are right—<i>right</i>.
Nobody could be harmed by you.... You are sweet and—and
wonderfully good....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree smiled wanly. “So we need speak no more.
We have done. There remains but one little thing,
mademoiselle. You love thees yo’ng man, and I love
thees yo’ng man.... He loves me now, and until I
am dead I shall keep him—keep him.... I shall make
to fight for him as I can.... But I am sorry that it mus’
make you sad—if I can keep him. I am ver’, ver’ sorry....
Good-by, mademoiselle, we shall not be friend’—no,
that ees not possible—and one of us mus’ be ver’
sad.... I mus’ pray that it shall not be myself....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-by,” said Maude, extending her hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Andree turned and walked with quaintly stiff tread
and daintily erect body out of the dining-room. Maude
ascended to her room to think, to readjust herself....
Her state of confusion was almost as great as Kendall
Ware’s. She was conscious of her own inadequacy and
of her inability to pierce to the true heart of events and
see them as they would be seen by a mind at once perfect
in logic and perfect in purity.... But, in spite of
prejudices bred into her being from youth, she could not
see Andree as otherwise than <i>right</i>, Andree as untainted
by evil ... and it seemed a thing impossible that
Kendall Ware could have been made one whit unworthier
by any contact with her....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Kendall Ware went to his office on September 1st
just as he went to it on any other day, anticipating
a day like a hundred of its predecessors had been. He
enjoyed the walk through the clear sunny air of Paris and
felt not the slightest foreboding of heavy events to come.
Fifteen minutes after his arrival the day had taken upon
itself the importance of marking the close of an epoch
in his life.... He was ordered to report himself in
Brest on the morning of September 4th to board the first
returning transport for America.</p>

<p class='c006'>The order partook of the essentials of a calamity. It
came so unexpectedly, with such sudden shock, that he
did not sense immediately the full meaning of it nor
what it involved. In the beginning he saw only the misfortune
of being sent home, of being removed from
proximity to the war. That alone was enough to give
him keenest distress, but as he returned to his desk and
sat staring gloomily at the wall before him this first
effect was swallowed up and lost forever by the inrush of
cold dread of the major consequences of his enforced
departure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Andree!...</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was face to face with the inexorability of the postponed
decision. There was no time to work matters out
gradually now, to hope for some miraculous solution. He
must decide; he must answer yes or no.... What should
he do about Andree?... Within twenty-four hours he
must determine if she was to remain in his life, or if they
had reached a point in the journey where one must turn
to the right and one to the left to follow roads that never
joined again on earth. He must determine whether or
not he should marry Andree and take her home. It
would be possible. There was time. He felt sure he
could obtain the necessary permission to have her accompany
him on the transport because he knew women were
constantly returning on transports. Even failing that,
she could demand her passport as his wife as a newly
made citizen of the United States and go to America by
way of Bordeaux and the French line.... But only
as his wife could she cross the ocean; in no other way
could she obtain the essential passport....</p>

<p class='c006'>So that became the one question—to marry or not to
marry!</p>

<p class='c006'>If he did not take her with him, then what? How
could he tell her?... What would she do if she discovered
that she had lost him? There came to him a
vision of the bridges crossing the Seine ... and it was
harrowing!</p>

<p class='c006'>The breaking of evil news is, perhaps, the most feared
task that can fall to man. He fears it as he fears no
other demand that can be made upon him.... It was
inevitable that Ken should consider eluding such a black
responsibility. Why not? It would be perfectly simple....
He was to see Andree to-morrow night. Well, there
was no need to see her, and the night after that he would
be on the train for Brest. He could step out of her life
without a word, abandon her without farewell.... It
would remove all complications—except the complication
of conscience. It was a temptation which did not persist.
Kendall Ware was no hero, but he was immeasurably
above such an act of black cowardice. Besides, he could
not bear to go without seeing her again ... if the decision
were to leave her.</p>

<p class='c006'>He must decide....</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a sentence from which there could be no reprieve,
implacable, inevitable. He had arrived at the
most critical, the most momentous crisis in his life ...
and nowhere could he turn for help. He stood alone,
sole judge and executioner. There was no jury to pronounce
verdict, no expert who could advise. He—Kendall
Ware—must speak the word.... Never had
he been so conscious of himself as an individual, of his
existence as a distinct entity, of <i>himself</i>. It frightened
him—that idea of himself as a responsible thing, of which
life could require decisions. For the first time he realized
the meaning of the words “free will” and he resented them.
God had endowed him with the perilous gift of freedom
to mold his own life, and he felt a cowardly resentment
toward God.... But the stark fact was there. There
was no avoiding it. There <i>must</i> be a choice, <i>some</i> choice
... and the combined populations of the earth could
not take it out of his hands....</p>

<p class='c006'>He was thankful for some minor matters of routine
which would demand his attention until noon. After
that he would be relieved from duty, with no occupation
but to make ready for his departure.... It was a
trifling postponement and he welcomed it eagerly. At
eleven-thirty he left the office and walked down the
Champs Élysées, almost for the last time. He pretended
that he was walking aimlessly, but it was not true. He
had a destination, and that destination was 12 rue d’Aguesseau
and Maude Knox.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not that he felt the necessity of seeing Maude
Knox, but that he wanted to talk to somebody, to talk
to somebody who might have some understanding of his
plight. It was not advice he sought so much as sympathy.
Maude was the sort of person he could talk to, and talk
was necessary.... He waited in the archway of the
building until she came down.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well?” she said, in some surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m waiting for you. Can you lunch with me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What has happened?” she countered. “I can tell by
your face that something has happened.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve been ordered home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She did not reply for a moment, for his announcement
brought her also face to face with a climax in her life.
<i>He was going home!</i> The <i>status quo</i> which had been endurable,
if difficult, was to be altered. While he was
there and she was there their relations might go on as they
were, somewhat anomalous, but requiring no immediate
decisions or arrangements. They could drift and allow
events to take care of themselves.... But now he was
going, and she realized that she did not want him to go.
She realized what she had repressed and concealed was
now insisting upon recognition—that Kendall Ware was
very important to her, that his presence was very important
to her, and that for a time to which she was
unable to set an exact limit she had been hoping that
their relations would be determined in a manner satisfactory
to herself.... She was bolder in facing the
fact than Kendall had been. She faced it promptly and
adjusted herself to it ... and the fact was that she
loved him....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where shall we lunch?” she asked, and it would have
been impossible to tell from her tone that in the brief
pause that came before her question she had withstood
a shock and mastered a crisis.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Oasis is quiet and we can talk.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But they’re so slow!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That doesn’t matter to-day. There’s—there’s so much
to say.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He nodded. “I’ve got to talk it out with you ...
because you are the only person who can do any good.
The same things are behind both of us. We know the
same sort of people back home.... Don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think so. But, remember, I’ve been here as long
as you have. I’m not the same. I’ve seen things, too....
I can’t judge anything the way I would have judged
it back home. I’ll never be able to again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked to the rue St.-Honoré and presently turned
up the rue Boissy-d’Anglas to the quaint, quiet little
English tea-room with its soft lights and absurdly carved
fireplace and decorations. That fireplace, Bert had once
said, looked like the life-work of a lazy man who loved to
whittle. There they found a table—there were but three
or four—and gave their orders to the thin, very serious
Englishwoman who was the only member of the staff
of the place who ever became visible. Nobody knew if
she were the proprietress or merely a waitress—and
nobody cared especially.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s rotten luck,” said Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll be stuck at some desk job in Washington. It
wouldn’t have been so bad if they had given me a few
months at the front—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Or if they never had sent you to France at all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He looked at her a moment, then shook his head.
“No. I wouldn’t have missed these months over here.
I’ve really lived; really appreciated being alive. No....
Whatever happens now, nobody can take this away from
me....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It has been wonderful,” she agreed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just to see it—Paris, the people, the war going on—would
be wonderful.... But I believe I’ve done more
than merely <i>see</i>. I’ve <i>felt</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’ve seen and felt, Ken, but how much has it
changed you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I mean, what has seeing and feeling done to you?
Has it made any permanent changes in you? Your
experiences here have impressed you a great deal—but
how long will the effect last when you get home?...
When Paris is just a memory—and a subject for conversation?
In ten years will you be any different as a
result of all this than you would have been if you had
never come?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He hesitated. “I don’t know,” he said, slowly. “What
do <i>you</i> think?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think,” she said, “that we will get back into the old
environments and the old habits and will become just
what we would have been. If we were to stay here,
then we might change, broaden, really profit by our
experiences. But we go home. We see the same
faces, hear the same sort of talk, and are tied by the
same sort of prejudices and theories and narrownesses
that we used to accept without question. We will
know better for a while, and then we will revert....
It takes something pretty big and startling to change
a person forever.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Big and startling.... You mean something in his
own life and experience—something personal to him—that
is big and startling?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, like committing a crime, or making some supreme
decision or sacrifice.... Anything that strains the very
soul of a person so that it can never get back into its
former shape.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Love?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not love itself, but something wonderful or terrible
that comes as the result of a love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you don’t think experiences change people, that
it is—well, just making decisions that grow out of the
experiences. It is reaching a crisis and then making a
choice of which way you will go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think that is it. I don’t see how any event can
change a person if he remains merely a spectator. I don’t
think any sort of happening will really alter a person for
good and all unless it has compelled him to use every bit
of his will and courage and intelligence to make up his
mind what he will do about it. If he chooses the right
way, then he becomes stronger; if he chooses the wrong
way or dodges the decision, he becomes weaker.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s no dodging the choice,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And that is what’s the matter with you, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the choice?” She knew very well what problem
he was laboring over.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is Andree,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She was bound to be the problem. Couldn’t you see
that from the beginning?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That doesn’t matter now—what I saw at the beginning.
All that has happened has happened”—he paused
and stared down at the table-cloth—“and I’m glad it did
happen.... But now I’ve got to settle the bill.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you want my advice?” She looked at him
queerly. “You have come to <i>me</i> for advice about this?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not for advice. I just want to know what you think.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“About what—definitely?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Whether I should marry Andree?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why shouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So many reasons.... There’s my mother. There’s
the vestibule of the Presbyterian church, if you know
what I mean.” She nodded her understanding. “There
are all the things that have come down from Plymouth
Rock.... There is something in me, something I can’t
get rid of, that is a result of all these things, which
makes me hold back from marrying a girl who—with
whom I have—who has been to me what Andree has
been.... And there is <i>you</i>.” He uttered the last sentence
defiantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That isn’t fair—it isn’t <i>fair</i>! You have no business
to say such a thing to me.... You’re the most tremendously
selfish man I have ever met.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Selfish!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In this whole thing you are thinking of nobody but
yourself. You haven’t thought of Andree—and then you—you
say such things without—considering me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do think of Andree,” he said, quickly. “I’m afraid—for
her. I can’t bear to think of making her unhappy....
And you—It’s a confused mess, Maude!...”
He leaned across the table. “Maude, if there was no
other woman in my life—if Andree were a thing of the
past—would you marry me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She stared at him, biting her lips. “Ken Ware,” she
said, “that is the most impertinent—and selfish—question
a man ever asked.... Don’t ever do it again! Don’t
ever mention such a thing again! The idea! You want
to have your cake and eat it, too. You’re always at it—carrying
on a sort of left-handed courtship with me....
Always hinting—and—and playing safe. If you decide
you don’t want this other girl, then you want to have
me all prepared to fall into your arms.... I won’t stand
it. Never dare speak of it again—until you can come to
me honestly and say that you <i>love</i> me—and that there is
no other woman in your life—and that you want me to
marry you. Then I’ll tell you whether I will or not....
Do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sorry. I’ve been clumsy ... and selfish.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you’ll tell me what you think—how this whole
thing over here affects you? Don’t think about my case
in particular if that is offensive, but about the whole
system, the whole idea of the relations between men and
women as we see them here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will, because I would like to find out just how I <i>have</i>
been affected....” Suddenly she laughed. “I used
to have an uncle who spent his life arguing abstractions.
I remember he took the stand once that there was no
reason why women should not smoke as well as men, that
there was nothing inherently masculine about smoking
and nothing immoral. He declared that women had as
much right to smoke as men. My aunt listened to it
until she got tired, so one evening she waited until uncle
lighted a cigar and then took out a cigarette and put it
between her lips.... Uncle stared at her and <i>roared</i>.
He fairly snatched that cigarette, and it looked as if
he was going to put my aunt out of the house....
Smoking for women was all right as an abstract question,
but when it touched him personally it was quite another
matter.... I think I am a little like him. I can sit
down and say that these girls are within their rights. I
can even see that they are good.... I believe your
Andree is wonderfully good.... I can even say that
if so many Americans were killed in this war that I
would never be able to find a husband I might do the
same thing—and I believe it would be <i>right</i> and moral
for me to do it ... in the <i>abstract</i>. I can feel these
things in Paris. But as soon as I come to a concrete
instance and one which touches me personally—why, I’m
Middle West and Plymouth Rock again.... One can
never tell. Things can happen here—even to an American
girl like me—that never could happen in America in
normal conditions. With this war going on, with this
horrible state of affairs, nothing else seems to matter
much. Personal moral considerations seem to be so
minute and unimportant as not to count at all....
There is something in the very air.... You see we
don’t know France—only a small section of it that we see
about the streets. We don’t know how the classes of
France who stay in their homes and are never seen on the
boulevards look at this matter. They may be as straitlaced
as we are ... and we’ve been judging all of Paris
by the Champs Élysées....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That doesn’t decide the thing that’s worrying me....
It doesn’t even help.... I wonder if this war and everything
connected with it won’t change people back home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So that they would tolerate—Andree?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never—if they found out that Andree had violated
their laws.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you—what do you think about her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that fair?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t see why it isn’t. You’ve met her and talked
with her. What do you think of her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ken, she is one individual, and I can tell you what I
think about her ... but that doesn’t make her stand for
the whole code of ethics. The other thousands of girls may
not be like Andree at all—they may be bad. Don’t you
see? It comes down to a matter of personal, concrete
experience again.... But Andree....” She looked at
him gravely. “I should hate to feel that I had broken
faith with Andree or been unfair to her or caused her grief.
She is very sweet and childlike—and <i>good</i>. She has
no consciousness of having been other than virtuous because
she has loved you.... I had lunch with her the
other day. It was the first time I had ever lunched with
a woman whom I knew to be violating our standard ...
and it didn’t hurt me in the least. I felt no repulsion or
disgust ... but that was because I couldn’t help feeling
that she was good....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you think—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think this: that all of us come to fit into our environment
very readily. We come over here, and soon
we are being absorbed by the things around us....
Presently we will go home, more or less in the frame of
mind created by Paris ... and then the environment
of home will begin to work. In no time at all we will
have adjusted ourselves again and Paris will be almost as
if it never had been.... I believe that is exactly what
will happen. If we stayed here we should become as nearly
Parisian as we could be made, but, going home, Paris will
very rapidly be eradicated.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And all that has happened here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will be part of a memory—something in a dream.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He shook his head. “I can’t believe that. I know I
shall never be just the same as I was before. I see your
point of view, but it doesn’t help me ... and I don’t
believe you are right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t want to believe it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know—Andree makes all the difference. If you were
a man and there had been an Andree you would have
felt as I have. Somehow France means Andree to me.
I never dreamed of any one like her. You don’t know
her—what a quaint, childlike, womanly, fairy kind of a
girl she is. When I think of her she doesn’t seem real,
but like some mysterious being out of a magical country
who has come to visit for a little while—to make me
happy.... She does come from a mysterious country.
Do you know that I don’t know her name—just Andree?
I have never asked. I don’t know where she lives or
how she lives. I don’t know anything about her except
that she appears and is with me a little while—and then
disappears again.... That has made a difference—that
quality.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would hardly have suspected you of being so romantic.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It isn’t sentimentality, at any rate.... And nobody
can ever convince me that I’ve done wrong or that I’ve
taken any harm from her.... Even if this should prove
to be only an episode, it has been a beautiful episode with
nothing but good in it.... But this mystery, this fairy
element, has somehow kept the realities at a distance. I
have simply gone along and <i>lived</i>.... Why, I have
hardly thought of such a thing as marriage in connection
with her. Possibly you won’t understand that, but I
understand it perfectly.... To marry Andree would
be to make her real, material. The mystery would be
gone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think I understand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But to marry her and take her to Detroit!... Suppose
I should take her home and then this story should
come out—and it <i>would</i> come out somehow. What then?...
When I think of that smug, gossiping crowd in the
church vestibule, and of their looking at her and pointing
at her and whispering about her—it seems like a profanation.
I couldn’t bear it.... And then—well, I’ve
inherited some of it myself. I belong to that crowd.
I’ve their ideas of marriage ... and the vestibule doesn’t
marry a girl who—has lived with a man....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re afraid of them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am,” he said, and flushed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But if you loved her—really loved her—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do,” he said, quickly, “but can’t one love without
wanting to marry? That is a thing that puzzles me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t believe anybody can love and be willing under
any circumstances to part with the person one loves.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know.... Isn’t it, possibly, better to love
and to be a part of a beautiful, rather mysterious, glowing
episode and to have it end while it is beautiful and mysterious?...
Then something always remains—something
dreamlike and lovely. To come down to actualities,
to marry, to take this mystery into the land of grocers’
bills and house-cleaning and the every-day problems of
marriage—why, it wouldn’t be the same thing at all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t think you believe that. You’re arguing with
yourself and trying to salve your conscience.... You’re
afraid to marry Andree and take her home—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is part of it. I admit it. But—and I am
sincere when I say it—I don’t know whether I want to
marry her. I love her and she loves me.... She
would be a wonderful wife—and yet, love and all, I
don’t know whether I want to marry her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are just trying to deceive yourself. Either you
don’t love her at all....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you marry a woman who had done what
Andree has done?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It would depend on the woman—and upon how much
I loved her.... You can’t generalize about that. It
is a matter that nobody can decide except for himself
in a particular instance. I do think, if I were a man,
that I could marry your Andree without a thought....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But to take her out of her world—away from Paris
where she is as natural and unconscious as the birds in
the trees—and set her down for life in Detroit ... to
be stared at and lied about and suspected ... it would
make her miserable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would it make her as miserable as to lose you altogether?
If she had you and your love, no matter what
unpleasant things were about, wouldn’t that be better
than to be left behind here alone?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” he said, honestly. “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked at him a moment, studying his face, which
was set and anxious and overcast, his eyes, which were
dull and brooding, and a wave of compassion surged up
within her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It has made you miserable,” she said. “I’m so sorry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I deserve to be miserable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Possibly not. Nobody can judge, but—this affair has
been almost inevitable. It wasn’t your fault and it
wasn’t Andree’s fault.... The circumstances were here,
and you two got tangled up in them....” She glanced
at her watch. “I must go now. I’m sorry I haven’t
helped you—for—I wish I might help you.... Shall
I see you again before you go?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m afraid not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then this is good-by.” She held out her hand
steadily. “I hope matters turn out for—for your happiness.... Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall write you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked at him and smiled queerly, but made no
rejoinder. “No, don’t come with me,” she said, as he
walked to the door. “I’d rather go alone.... Good-by
and a safe voyage.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And so the first of the two women with whom his life
had become involved stepped out of his life....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>When Kendall went to the apartment for dinner
Arlette came bustling into the hall as she heard
him open the door, and, poking again and again with a
pudgy finger toward the rear of the place, she exclaimed,
excitedly: “Monsieur Bert!... Monsieur Bert!...”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>” She grinned with delight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hey, Bert!” shouted Ken, delighted, for he had
feared he would not see his friend again before he sailed.
Bert came out of the door, half shaved, with a towel
about his neck, and shook hands after the manner of
healthy young men.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Howdy, old-timer! Gosh! it seems good to get back
to you and Arlette. How have things been going without
me? Seen Madeleine?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Haven’t seen her. Things have been going all right
till to-day. This morning the blow fell.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What blow?... You look as if somebody had stolen
your pet goat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m ordered to America. Leave Wednesday.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The devil!... Oh, say, that’s rotten luck! What’s
the idea?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t know. Just my confounded luck, I expect.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait a minute till I finish this shave and I’ll help you
weep.... How’s Andree?”</p>

<p class='c006'>They were walking back to Bert’s room, and Ken did
not answer until his friend stood before the glass, razor in
hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’s all right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How did she take the news?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She doesn’t know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Doesn’t know!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I just got my orders this morning. Won’t see her
until to-morrow night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Coming to dinner?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll pull a party—farewell party with all the trimmings,
eh? I’ll get Madeleine and we’ll dig up a bottle
of champagne and wring a <i>poulet</i> out of Arlette if we
have to call in the police to help us. I’ll bet they would,
at that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It won’t be a very merry party,” said Ken, lugubriously.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert turned and looked at Ken. “Huh!... Something
eating you again?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s a rotten mess. I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“About Andree? It isn’t any mess at all. You’ve
had a good time and she’s had a good time. That’s all
there is to it. Now you’ve got to go home. She didn’t
expect anything else.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken was silent.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Unless you’ve made her expect something else....
Now Madeleine and I had an understanding right at the
start,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish I could get it off my mind for a couple of
hours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Get it off, then. We’ll go to the Folies or the Olympia
or some place to-night. To-morrow I’ll look up
Madeleine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken was willing to go anywhere, to do anything, so
long as he was helped to keep Andree off his mind, and
to think about something besides the inevitability of the
decision. So, after, they went to the Folies, arriving
after the performance had begun. They did not take
seats, but made their way through the big table-filled
room to the theater proper, and stood up with the crowd
behind the railing. The house was full, but even when
the house was not filled many of the spectators remained
in the promenade to walk about and smoke and, possibly,
to put themselves in the way of being accosted by
some of the numerous and sometimes pretty <i>habituées</i>
of the place.</p>

<p class='c006'>The entertainment was directed to the American soldier,
and much of it was in English. But it could not hold
Kendall’s attention. It was, in fact, a mediocre performance,
with an act or so that was deserving of
attention. After seeing the perfection of the performances
at the Comédie Française Ken wondered at the
halting stage management of this popular music-hall. It
hitched along. Choruses seemed to improvise rather than
to have been drilled. Nobody seemed to know just how
to get on and off the stage, and when a scene or an act
or a chorus number ended, it simply ended.... Every
now and then animated conversations broke out in the
back of the theater, and ushers walked about through the
crowd, saying: “Hush!... Husss-sh!” The whole
thing depressed Ken instead of lifting his spirits, and he
actually experienced a feeling of disgust at the grand
closing number in which the <i>première danseuse</i> appeared
as an American cowboy, in white tights and waving an
American flag.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s get out of here,” he said, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Suits me,” said Bert, and they jostled their way to
the street, ignoring more than one tentative “<i>Bon soir,
monsieur</i>,” from young women whose cheeks were not
guiltless of what the phrase of the streets termed
camouflage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Want to walk home?” suggested Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.” Ken did want to walk. He wanted to tire
himself so that he could sleep, for he was afraid of a sleepless
night. So they started off briskly, cutting through
dark and narrow streets to the Boulevard Haussmann
and thence into the Avenue Friedland, which they followed
to the rue Beaujon and into the Avenue Hoche.
They climbed the stairs of the apartment, and Bert, as
was his custom, searched the cupboards to see if Arlette
had left anything unconcealed that might be eaten. But
Arlette had been careful, as usual, and nothing was
to be found except a box of dry cookies. It was not
Arlette’s intention that her young officers should waste
their substance by eating up her supplies at unexpected
hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken dreaded to go into his room alone and turn off the
lights, so it was Bert who made the first movement to go
to bed. Ken carried in with him a sleep-provoking book
on militarism which an earnest friend had forced upon
him, undressed, and stretched himself on the bed with the
small light on his table to read by. He forced himself to
read ... and presently fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next day was filled with errands and shopping. He
wandered about the stores, selecting inexpensive souvenirs
for his friends and presents for his mother and father.
It was hot, and it irritated him to push and shove in the
milling crowds that jammed the Printemps and the
Galeries Lafayette, but it kept him busy and gave him an
excuse for pushing his decision another hour and still
another hour into the future.... His last errand was the
selection of a present for Andree, a farewell gift, or a gift
of some other sort. There had to be a gift, so he spent
more money than he could afford in a little bracelet of
gold set with tiny pearls.... Then he went home, for
it was near the dinner hour.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert was there before him, wearing such an expression of
sheepishness and chagrin as Kendall had never seen
before on his friend’s face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where’s Madeleine?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bert grinned mirthlessly. “Don’t know,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t she coming?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I left a note at her hotel inviting her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Didn’t see her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. I went around to the hotel and there was a
small boy in the <i>concierge’s</i> room. He said Madeleine
was out with an American officer.... Then I went up
the street, and pretty soon I thought I saw her with a
lieutenant. They were a block away and I hustled up to
make sure, but they turned off and disappeared. Looked
like she caught sight of me and ducked.... Anyhow,
I went back and left a note. Maybe I was mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Serves you right,” said Ken. “You were so darn
sure—you with your understandings.... Three weeks
were too much for her, and she’s passed you up for
somebody who isn’t always telling her she’s just a temporary
arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go chase yourself,” said Bert. “It makes no difference
in my young life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Ken noticed that every minute or so Bert strolled
with elaborate nonchalance to the window and looked
down the street. Ken smiled. Bert’s manner was not
that of a man whose heart suffers, but who has taken
an injury to his pride....</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here comes Andree,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken did not go to look, as he usually did. It was not
that he did not want to see Andree, but her arrival
brought his affairs to the acute stage. He had put off
and put off the struggle to reach a decision; had occupied
his mind with other matters, crowding out as much as
was possible any thoughts of Andree and of what he
was going to do about her. True, the thing had been
with him always, lurking in the background and ready
to step out at the least encouragement. But he had not
approached it directly. It had been a sort of dull ache
that he was always conscious of, but which he had been
able to stifle. Now she was coming, was almost at the
door. It would be a matter of minutes only before he
would have to tell her that he was going away....
Even now he did not admit to himself that he had reached
a partial decision, indeed that he had not required to
make a decision upon one point. That was taking her
with him. He had told himself that it would be possible
to marry her and to take her on the transport that carried
him, but it was self-deception, and he knew it was
self-deception. In his heart he knew now, as he had
known, that to-night he would say good-by to Andree
and go to America without her.... He might come back
for her, might even marry her before he went away, to
have her follow him on another vessel. But there would
be a parting, temporary or permanent....</p>

<p class='c006'>He had never asked himself if Andree would marry him.
The idea that she would not do so had never entered his
head, which was significant. It was that which made his
decision doubly difficult, for she was wholly in his hands,
had given herself to him to do with as he pleased, and
her life was his to break if he wished to do so.... He
persuaded himself that his hesitation was more on her
account than his own, that it would be impossible for her
to be happy in the conditions which would be found in
America, or that perhaps it would be impossible. He
believed that he was trying to decide what would be
best for her—or almost believed it. It may be that he
was not wholly selfish, not thinking solely of himself and
of the effects of his marriage with Andree upon himself.
At any rate, his anxiety for her was very real and very
disturbing.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was coming up the stairs utterly unconscious of
what awaited her, confident in a future with him which
would not be disturbed for so long a time that it need not
now be considered. An event that is a year distant is
very far away to a young girl. If Andree had known she
would lose Kendall in a year she would not have thought
about it now ... nor until the year was drawing to a
close. It is the ability to hope that makes this possible.
Something might turn up within the year.... But now
she was stepping into the event! In a few minutes she
would hear his voice telling her that he was going away
to-morrow—not in a year, not in a month, but <i>to-morrow!</i>...
When he told her that he must tell her more. A
mere announcement of his departure would not suffice;
he must supplement it by telling her if their good-bys
were forever, or for a few days or months....</p>

<p class='c006'>The bell rang and he went to the door and opened it.
She stood there very demure and self-contained and
grave—dressed in white as he had seen her first. She
lifted her eyes to his and smiled and then became
grave and wistful again, for she saw that he was not
happy.... He held out his arms to her and drew her
in, realizing that it was the last time he should ever
draw her slender daintiness through that door, the last
time she would ever enter that apartment. It was the
beginning of the end of that phase in their lives, of
the untrammeled romance, the quaint mystery, the
adventurous sweetness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are <i>triste</i>,” she said, anxiously. “Is it that you
have worked too hard?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are not <i>joyeux</i> to see me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He took her face between his hands and looked down
into her deep-shaded eyes. “You must not say that....
You must never say that. It is not true.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I am ver’ glad.” She smiled. “Monsieur Bert
and Mademoiselle Madeleine they are here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bert is here, but Madeleine hasn’t come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I desire her to be here.” She stepped into the <i>salon</i>
and spoke to Bert. “You shall go to fetch her. Now....
Now. You shall run ver’ fast.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I asked her to come,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And she would not?” Andree’s voice showed profound
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m afraid she got tired of waiting for me to come back
to Paris.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But no, that ees not possible. She would not be
tired to wait. She would be ver’ glad when you return.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll see. If she isn’t here in five minutes she won’t
be coming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why do you theenk?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I guess she has another American officer. I
think I saw her with one to-day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, <i>non, non, non!</i> That would be ver’ bad. I do
not believe. Mademoiselle Madeleine is <i>fidèle</i>. You shall
see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why are you so sure, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?...</i>” She shrugged her shoulders. “Bicause
it would be so. If Monsieur Ken should go for
three week, for three mont’, for three year, I should wait
and be <i>très-fidèle</i>. I should find no other <i>officier américain</i>.
<i>Non, non</i>, it would not be well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s Arlette’s head,” said Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No need to wait,” Bert said, irritably. “She won’t
come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We should wait,” said Andree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Until a quarter past seven, then.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But a quarter past seven arrived and Madeleine did not
arrive.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s eat,” said Bert. “She’s given me the sack.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pauvre Monsieur Bert.</i> It ees ver’ sad. Oh, she is
<i>très-méchante</i>, ver’ naughty. I do not onderstan’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They went out to the table and sat down. Kendall sat
in gloomy silence, Bert was suffering from wounded vanity,
and Andree looked from one to the other uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is <i>nécessaire</i> to smile,” she said, and touched Ken’s
hand with her finger-tips.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t feel much like smiling, <i>mignonne</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pourquoi?</i>”</p>

<p class='c006'>Arlette entered with the <i>potage</i> to save him from replying
to her question, and, placing the huge bowl in the middle
of the table, stood regarding Andree dolefully, with two
big tears standing on her fat cheeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Even Arlette makes to weep,” said Andree. “It is
ver’ strange. What is happen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Pauvre mademoiselle! ... pauvre mademoiselle!...</i>”
said Arlette, and, turning very abruptly, she scuttled out
of the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Qu’est-ce que c’est?...</i> Why does she speak this
theeng?” She turned startled eyes upon Ken.</p>

<p class='c006'>He hesitated, bit his lip, then he reached out and took
her hand and pressed it to his lips. “I have been ordered
to America,” he said, baldly.</p>

<p class='c006'>She did not speak, did not stir. It seemed to him that
her expression did not alter by so much as a shade. She
was <i>still</i>. It was almost as if animation were suspended.
Andree did not turn her eyes from his face, nor did she
move or speak. She did not gaze at him questioningly
nor accusingly nor imploringly—she merely gazed with
that accompaniment of <i>stillness</i>!... He felt that he
must speak and break that quietness which he could feel
as with a physical pain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I got my orders yesterday.... I—it didn’t seem
possible. I couldn’t believe it.... I only knew yesterday.”
He felt that he must clear himself of any guilt of
concealment, of having known of this thing and kept it
from her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Quand?</i>” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I go to-morrow night—to Brest, and then to America.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She turned to her plate and began to eat. She had
uttered no complaint, shed no tear, done none of the things
he had dreaded she might do. There had been no painful
scene, but he was not relieved. She was so <i>still</i>!</p>

<p class='c006'>He fumbled in his pocket and took out the little jeweler’s
package and removed the bracelet. She watched him
gravely, with no outward sign of emotion, and when he
reached for her hand she gave it to him unprotestingly.
He snapped the bracelet about her wrist. She looked
down at it, and then up into his face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is ver’ pretty,” she said, “and you are mos’ good to
me....” That was all, but every now and then he
saw her staring at the bracelet and staring at it as if it
were something strange and inexplicable. Once she
reached across with her other hand and touched it, felt
of it, as if to assure herself that it was really there, an
actual thing and not imagined.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ken tried to talk, Bert tried to talk, but the effort was
futile. Dead, cold silences fell.... The sensations of
that meal would remain with Kendall as long as he should
live, a recurrent nightmare. Presently Bert arose. He
did a thing which he had never done before—lifted
Andree’s hand and touched it with his lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must go, mademoiselle,” he said. “Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-by, Monsieur Bert,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then they were alone!</p>

<p class='c006'>In the <i>salon</i> he drew her down beside him on the sofa
and held her close.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am very sad, <i>mignonne</i>,” he said. “I love
you....”</p>

<p class='c006'>She studied his face a moment and smiled at very trifle
of a smile. “That is well,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am not going away because I want to. It is orders.
I have to obey.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>C’est la guerre</i>,” she said, gravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, it is the war, but it’s cruel—it’s rotten. I want
to stay here, to stay with you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish that also,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Something was demanded of him. He must say something,
must not keep this child in agony, not knowing
what he intended to do with respect to her. It was her
right to know.... He must decide, and he must tell
her.... But again he put it off. There was time enough,
and before he told her there was still the chance of one
last happy evening.... He wanted that, wanted the
memory of it, if nothing more.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne</i>, do you love me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is certain.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very much?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot say how much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“America is not far,” he said, with some idiotic intention
to comfort her. “The ocean can be crossed in a
week.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is true,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her head was against his breast, her eyes staring into
her lap. Ken looked straight before him, thinking, thinking.
His mind was very clear, as if lighted by that painful
white light which seemed to pour in upon his consciousness
in moments of mental stress. It seemed to
him as if his eyes could pierce the walls if he willed it,
as if his memory could show him every minute incident
in his whole life, as if he could see and understand everything—everything.
He drew her to him fiercely, but even
as he was sensing the softness of her slender body against
his side he was seeing the vestibule of the Presbyterian
church, he was watching it function. The individuals
stood before him as if alive, every well-known feature distinct.
It was photographic. He could see changes of
expression, hear whispers, see cautious hands placed
before gossiping lips ... and he could see himself
passing through that little group with Andree on his
arm!...</p>

<p class='c006'>He could see his own home—his return to it. He
could see his mother and feel the hostility that sprang to
life the instant her eyes rested on Andree. He could read
his mother’s thoughts ... and his father’s. There was
the one bright spot. He could see his father kissing
Andree diffidently and patting her hand and telling her
how glad he was to see her and asking how his son had
ever managed to capture such a pretty girl.... There
would be no doubt of her welcome at his father’s hands....
But his mother—that cold hostility, that hard-eyed
suspicion!... And then, when she had him alone, the
catechism he would undergo, and the resentment and
jealousy she would exhibit....</p>

<p class='c006'>He could see his friends and the neighbors of his childhood
with their crass curiosity and their hints and whispers....
He knew their every thought ... could see
their eyes fixed on Andree speculatively ... some of them
hopefully!</p>

<p class='c006'>It was that he would have to take her, too.... And
then, if the story should come out!... But that would
be little worse.... Perhaps he exaggerated, perhaps he
saw his old friends and acquaintances in characters which
were not truly theirs. There might have been more
charity among them than he perceived, more kindness
and less narrowness and insularity.... But he did not
see them except as he feared they might be.</p>

<p class='c006'>What of himself? How would he feel to find himself
married to a girl who had violated the standards of
Plymouth Rock, even though he had been the one to
profit by that violation?... Even if none ever found
it out but himself? He would know it.... It would
constantly be recurring to him—or would it not? He did
not know. The thing did not affect him now. It did
not make Andree the less desirable and lovable and <i>good</i>.
Perhaps that would persist—but his prejudices were deep-seated,
had their roots in an older generation and were
not lightly to be cast out....</p>

<p class='c006'>But he loved her.... In spite of all that he saw and
felt and feared, he knew that he loved her, and that to
know she was removed forever from his life would be to
lose a wonderful thing that he could not bear to lose....
The decision lay between love and expediency.... If
only he could live in Paris and never return to America!
How easy it would be then!</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you miss me?” he asked, clumsily.</p>

<p class='c006'>She stirred in his arms and held her face up to his. “I
shall be ver’ sad,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Suppose—suppose something should happen to me
and I could never come back?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She held his hand very tightly. “I do not know,” she
said. “I cannot to theenk of that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He must decide.... He must decide.... But he
was afraid; he <i>could not</i> decide—not now, not yet....
There were hours ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>She asked nothing of him, made no demands, but
waited, waited. He could feel her waiting, hoping for
some word, some assurance that he was not going to
desert her forever, that he would come back to her—and
he could not give that assurance ... not yet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It might be six months; it might be a year before I
could come back.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She smiled. “I would be here,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And <i>fidèle</i>?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know,” she answered. “There would be no
thought only jus’ for you....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But America is strange. It would not be Paris. You
might be unhappy there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That ees ver’ silly.... Where you are I shall always
be happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He leaped to his feet and paced up and down the room,
then stopped suddenly before her. “What shall I do?...
What shall I do?” he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot say. I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know I love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I believe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t decide. I can’t tell what to do.... I don’t
know what I can do, what will be possible.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She made no answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can’t we pretend just for a while, just for a few hours,
that I am not going and that everything is going along
just as it is? Can’t we have just one more little moment
of happiness?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It ees not <i>facile</i>—not easy—to pretend so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But we will try ... I want to see you smile. I want
to see you happy once more. I’ve got to see you happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She sat erect and smiled, then the smile faded and she
clenched her little fists in her lap. “Oh, I shall be so
<i>solitaire</i>, so lonely—so lonely....” It was her only
departure from that still calmness, her only approach to
emotion, to giving away to grief, and it passed swiftly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See, I make to laugh now. For thees night I shall
laugh, bicause you wish it, and I do not wish you to be
sad and to make thees <i>grimace</i>.... You mus’ sit here
beside me now thees minute. You mus’ to sit here and
love me so ver’ much, and we shall be mos’ happy....
Oh, I shall theenk of thees Monsieur Bert and how ver’
fonny his face made itself to look. He is ver’ droll—thees
high yo’ng man.... It ees ver’ bad that you do
not have a piano, for then I can dance for you.... You
must to get a piano ver’ quickly—now, now.... You
shall send out to fetch one or I shall go away....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne ... mignonne....</i>” he said, and buried
his face in her lap....</p>

<p class='c006'>She sat looking down at him very gravely, stroking his
hair with her soft, slender fingers....</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c006'>The taxicab hurried them down the Champs Élysées
through the cool morning air—on their last ride together
in Paris.... He was conscious of the city about them,
of the essence of the marvelous city from which he was
so soon to depart.... There is something in the air of
Paris, something that one cannot escape, something intangible,
enticing, exciting.... He would miss it, miss
it very much.... Andree, too, was looking out of the
window. She sat very still and did not speak. Her face
was grave and expressionless with that look of abstraction
which she wore as some wild bird of the forest wears its
protective coloring.... He reached out and took her
hand, holding it silently....</p>

<p class='c006'>His decision had not been made. He had given her
neither assurance of his return nor had he told her that
they were about to part forever.... He did not know,
and he could not decide ... there were now only minutes—seconds.
He could see the Élysées Palace Hôtel ahead,
his destination, where he would say good-by to her....
And again, with a weakness which made him despise
himself, he evaded the issue.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will write to me—often?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.... And you?” It was her first question since
he had told her he was to go; the first time she had
demanded anything of him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall write. I shall tell you everything.... Everything
will come right somehow. It must come right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have not your address.” She spoke very calmly.</p>

<p class='c006'>He wrote it on a slip of paper and handed it to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you have not my address—nor my name.” She
smiled with that quaint lightening of the face which always
stirred him to tenderness.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had not wanted to know her name nor her address.
He had loved the mystery of it and of her. But the
mystery must end. He gave her his memorandum—book
and she wrote, but he did not look at the page, closing
the book and placing it in his pocket.... She was still
a mystery—he would look when it became necessary to
look, and not before.</p>

<p class='c006'>The taxicab was stopping. They looked at each other,
but even now she gave no sign of distress, shed no tear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Mignonne....</i>” he whispered, and drew her into his
arms. “Good-by.... Good-by.... I love you....”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-by,” she said, gravely. “I also love you ...
and I shall be always <i>fidèle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He opened the door and alighted; then he turned and
lifted her hand to his lips. She did not smile; her face
was immobile, her eyes were fixed on his face with a
strange expression of detachment, of abstraction. He
kissed her hand again and turned abruptly away. But
he could not leave her so.... He turned; the taxi was
starting. He called and ran toward the curb, but the
chauffeur did not hear.... He was too late; the machine
gained headway and swept around the corner—and
she was gone....</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>After a sleepless, uncomfortable night, spent sitting
bolt upright in a compartment of the Paris-Brest
train, Kendall arrived at the dirty, unkempt, unattractive
seaport which was his destination. His baggage was
taken from him by the branch of the army which looked
after such matters, and he found his way to the provost’s
office, where he showed his orders and was told to report
daily to see if his name was posted in the list of those to
sail. No further information was given him as to the
date of his departure nor the vessel upon which he should
sail.</p>

<p class='c006'>He secured a room at the Continental Hôtel, the best the
city afforded, and found it unspeakable—and then for six
interminable days he wandered about the town, waiting,
waiting for the convoy which seemed destined never to
arrive. He played innumerable games of bridge, walked
a dozen times a day to a vantage-point on the old fortifications
from which he could gain a panoramic view of the
harbor and its jostling craft.... Far out at the entrance
swayed and tossed an observation balloon, keeping ceaseless
watch of the sea for lurking submarines....</p>

<p class='c006'>No vessels came save one, the torpedoed <i>Mt. Vernon</i>,
which had sailed early on the morning of his arrival. It
staggered into port with a great hole in its side, and
presently disappeared into dry dock farther into the bay....
Then the report spread that cholera had broken
out in the town and was magnified to appalling proportions....
There was nothing to do but play bridge and
walk to the harbor to look for an incoming convoy, and to
eat and sleep. It was maddening....</p>

<p class='c006'>The harbor ceased to be interesting. German prisoners
compelled to labor on the docks became commonplace;
scurrying destroyers failed to stir the imagination....
And then one morning Ken walked to his usual vantage-point
and saw at anchor the gigantic <i>Leviathan</i>....</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently orders were posted and his name appeared
upon the list. He was to report himself with his hand-baggage
at a certain point early next morning.... The
morning was overcast and cold, with a chilling, slanting
drizzle of rain, and everybody was out of spirits and uncomfortable
as they waited for the lighter to carry them
out to the transport. There was no shelter, and they
stood about the deck of the little boat, backs to the
slashing rain, for no sooner had they left the wharf than
the rain descended in earnest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally they were on board and were assigned to rooms,
but this was not the end of the waiting. Forty-eight
hours remained while the vessel was being coaled, but
at last she started, a consort on either side and a flock of
destroyers for convoy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The voyage was not unpleasant, and it was interesting,
at least, to watch the little destroyers plunging and rolling
through the great waves until one night they disappeared
and left the three transports alone.... There were six
days and a half of plowing westward through the Atlantic,
days when one wore constantly his life-jacket and rather
expected to hear at any moment the detonation of the
defensive guns or the explosion of a torpedo against the
vessel’s sides.... But at last land came into view—only
to be obscured by fog that compelled the <i>Leviathan</i> to
crawl along, feeling her way with the lead.... And then,
as suddenly as it had come, the fog vanished and they
were in the harbor, with the Goddess visible ahead and the
sky-line of the metropolis over to the right.... Nobody
left the deck. It was an experience and every man
wanted to feel every second of it, witness every manifestation
of it.... Vessels cheered them and they cheered
in return.... It was America—home. They had been
to the war and had returned, some of them battered,
broken, but nevertheless returned. It was exhilarating,
wonderful.</p>

<p class='c006'>An early morning ferry-boat, crowded with civilians,
ran under their bows, and some competent individual
led the cheering. <i>Crash, crash, crash</i>, sounded the enthusiastic
welcome of those who had remained behind,
and every man on the transport knew that those cheers
were for <i>him</i>....</p>

<p class='c006'>The great vessel swung about and docked by the aid of
snorting, grunting tugs, and after more delays and formalities
they set foot on shore.... Kendall went directly
to the Pennsylvania station to book a lower berth for
Washington.</p>

<p class='c006'>A week later he was in Detroit on furlough—in his old
home, amid familiar surroundings ... under his own
roof with his father and mother. It was very much the
same. The war touched the life of the city but lightly.
It was all as he remembered it, all as he had expected it
to be ... and Paris and the distant war seemed to be
matters that had occurred in a dream.... On Sunday
he went to church with his mother and father and received
the homage and congratulations of the vestibule....</p>

<p class='c006'>That afternoon he went to his room to write—to write
the promised letter to Andree. It was not easy ... for
the decision had not yet been made. He wrote and
destroyed and wrote again. He promised to return; he
assured her of his love ... but when he read he was not
satisfied.... He was in Detroit, in another world, and
Andree did not belong to that world. He was surprised
to find how well this world satisfied him and how unreal
that other world he had known and loved had become....
This was <i>his</i> world, these were the things <i>he</i> was meant
to do and the thoughts <i>he</i> was meant to think. This was
America, and he was an American!...</p>

<p class='c006'>He tried to think of Paris, to get back again into the
spirit of Paris, but could not do so.... It had become
unreal, distant, not appealing....</p>

<p class='c006'>But Andree ... she was not unreal, not distant. She
was very real, present in his heart—and yet she was of
that other world, a stranger, an alien.... He loved
her—but—There was always that <i>but</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>He wrote still another letter and read it. Yes, he had
decided. He could not give her up. He would bring
her here and let the consequences be what they might....
The letter was placed in its envelop and he drew
out his note-book to look for her address.... It was
there, those written words which should forever remove
Andree from the land of lovely mystery.... But he
did not open the book. It lay in his hand, but he dared
not open it.... He went to the window and looked
out upon the street, that typically American, typically
Middle-Western street.... He stood so for many minutes,
then walked toward the fireplace and tossed the
note-book into the blaze.... The thing was done, the
decision was made and was irrevocable ... and Andree
would always remain a glowing mystery....</p>

<p class='c006'>He went again to his desk and wrote another letter.
It was brief:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dear Maude</span>—There is no woman in my life but you.
When you come home I shall come to you for my answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>He inclosed it, addressed it, stamped it, and went out
to the post-box on the corner. Even now he hesitated a
moment, but it was only a moment.... The letter
dropped inside. It could not be recalled.</p>

<p class='c006'>But he did not move from the spot. For a long time
he stood staring before him with eyes that did not see
the typically American street, with a consciousness that
did not feel his typically Middle-Western surroundings....
What he felt was that something true and faithful
and beautiful had found a place in his life never to be
removed. What he saw was a vision of Andree, waiting ... waiting....</p>
